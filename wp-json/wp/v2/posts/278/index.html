It is the process of distributing and entrusting work to another person, and therefore one of the core concepts of management leadership. The process involves managers deciding which work they should do themselves and which work should be delegated to others for completion.[1] From a managerial standpoint, delegation involves shifting project responsibility to team members, giving them the opportunity to finalize the work product effectively, with minimal intervention. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions. It is a shifting of decision-making authority as well as responsibility for the results from one organisational level to another lower one. However, a certain level of accountability for the outcome of the work does remain with the person who delegated the work to begin with.<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/online.hbs.edu\/blog\/post\/how-to-delegate-effectively\" target=\"_blank\">How to Delegate Effectively<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shreyas\/status\/1401615513998950401\" target=\"_blank\">Radical Delegation by Shreyas Doshi<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul id=\"timemanagement\"><li><strong><em>Time Management<\/em><\/strong><ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/todoist.com\/productivity-methods\/eisenhower-matrix\" target=\"_blank\">Eisenhower Matrix<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/strategy\/6-time-management-techniques-to-help-you-get-everything-done-02166826\" target=\"_blank\">Other Techniques<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently, I spoke to a group of new managers (mostly) and people who&#8217;ve transitioned from a Product\/Program Management role about surprises that new people managers [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":304,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/278"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=278"}],"version-history":[{"count":23,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/278\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":516,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/278\/revisions\/516"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/304"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=278"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=278"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/localhost:8888\/mySite\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=278"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
