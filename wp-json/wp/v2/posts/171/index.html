He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old?

To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.&#8221;<\/em><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong><em>Socratic Dialogue<\/em><\/strong><ul><li>Help someone realize the answer to their question \/ self discovery through the use of their own words<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><strong>No-o Dynamics<\/strong><ul><li>Man&#8217;s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium.
