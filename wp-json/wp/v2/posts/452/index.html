It underscores the fact that customers don\u2019t buy your product for its cutting-edge spec or features, they are buying it for solving their problem, so focus on the problem and you\u2019ll never have to worry about lack of customers. This is applicable for everything that we do, day in and day out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Videos I Watched<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History<\/a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0How did one man\u2019s effort or a specific business\u2019s interest create a long standing health problem and environmental catastrophe of the modern world is the premise of this video.

From the podcast excerpt &#8211; \u201c<em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we\u2019re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either\/or choices. But psychologist\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/lerner.udel.edu\/faculty-staff-directory\/wendy-smith\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wendy Smith<\/a>\u00a0says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap.
