Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ActorMadhavan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">R.Madhavan<\/a> for making this and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nambi_Narayanan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dr. Nambi<\/a> an unsung hero who&#8217;s love for this country and passion for science has no parallels. What intrigued me when I watched this movie, is the impact media (news\/television\/social media etc.) has in creating a viral perception (right \/wrong) about a person and how we as consumers embrace that without question and judge people. In an era of AI taking over content creation and propagation, it&#8217;s very important that each one of us have some moral and factual compass before coming to a judgement on piece of info we see out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>Podcasts I\u2019m listening<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/hiddenbrain.org\/podcast\/you-2-0-befriending-your-inner-voice\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">You 2.0 &#8211; Befriending your inner voice<\/a> \u2013 What we say to ourselves, and our inner voice is a big contributor to how we think, act, react and transform.
