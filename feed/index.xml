<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/18/1061320/digital-clones-of-dead-people/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Technology that lets us “speak” to our dead relatives has arrived. Are we ready?</a> – Personally, I believe tech like this would only worsen grief than help. With AI getter significantly better each day, there’s going to be more dilemmas like these that we need to be prepared to handle. </p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2Y0GMCFWq0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Could one vaccine protect against everything?</a> – This is the same question I had when taking 3 shots of the COVID vaccine. I wonder how a world without diseases would look like and what would happen to the entire healthcare sector (apart from these vaccine makers) when this becomes true.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m Listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-layne-norton-the-science-of-eating-for-health-fat-loss-and-lean-muscle/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Dr. Layne Norton: The Science of Eating&#8230;</a> – From the Huberman Lab podcast, this is by far the most comprehensive information I’ve seen on diet, nutrition, Health &amp; the entire science behind it. Dr. Layne and Dr. Huberman cover a wide variety of important topics in this really long form episode, but you can find timestamps to sections that you can use to know about things you feel important.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings  </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Age of PageRank is Over!</a> – With search patterns increasingly moving over from traditional search engines to products like TikTok, Instagram etc, it’s only natural that we’ll very soon have AI powered, hyper-personalized search systems that’ll determine what I see, read, use and recommend.</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>You don’t stop having fun because you get old; You get Old because you stop having Fun</p>
<cite>Anon</cite></blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/think.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How to Think for yourself</a> – In this article, Paul Graham talks about importance of independent thinking. He also lists out what it means to be an independent thinker and the components of independent thinking and how we can nurture it.  I resonate with the thought that you are largely influenced by the kind of people you surround yourself with, so be open to diverse experiences, meeting and learning from new people.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXwStduNw14" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Mathematics is the sense you never knew you had!</a> – I wish I had a Maths teacher like Eddie woo. In this inspiring TED talk he makes a case for why Mathematics is a sense just like touch &amp; sound and in the process inspires us to think differently about it. I wish schools taught these early on.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Books I’m re-reading</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15824358-the-first-90-days" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The First 90 days</a> – This book is a roadmap for how to navigate career transitions, organizational changes and internal promotions in a way that helps speed up the process of you becoming effective, faster and smarter.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings  </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://architecturenotes.co/redis/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Architecture Notes &#8211; Redis</a> – Architecture Notes is quickly becoming my go to place to reinforce fundamentals. I like the way the content is organized and presented in an effective way to makes learning fun.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220928-the-non-linear-workdays-changing-the-shape-of-productivity" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Non-linear workdays changing the shape of productivity</a> – 9 to 5 work model is dead and as the world shifted to the hybrid work model employees now can craft their work schedules that suits them the best and takes into account their natural working rhythms. While greater flexibility will lead to greater productivity, it is important to have a clearly defined process and guideposts that prevent employees from straying too far away from a collaborative working schedule.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWTNMzK9vG4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Why you procrastinate even when it feels bad</a> – I’m a master procrastinator and have been trying hard to overcome it for many years now (maybe procrastinating too much the actions required to overcome procrastination!) While I’ve gotten progressively better it’s important to understand the underlying reasons for why we put off things so we can learn to become better. This video talks about the importance of balancing emotions and how they can affect why we put off certain things and what we can do to change.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I Listened</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://hbr.org/video/6312276697112/how-to-work-with-a-passiveaggressive-coworker-the-harvard-business-review-guide" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How to Work with a Passive-Aggressive Coworker</a> – From the HBR channel, this is an 8 min video episode with some great tips to deal with passive aggressive folks at work. We’ve all been there on both sides of the table and understanding this a bit more can help us all become a bit better.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings  </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://roadmap.sh/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Career Roadmaps for Developers</a> – By far one of the best organized contents I’ve seen to help developers in picking up a path and guide their learning. Best part – it’s open source, so if you want to add something you don’t see and think it’ll be useful for the community, submit a PR.</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Don’t be fooled by the calendar. There are only as many days in the year as you make use of. One man gets only a week’s value out of a year while another man gets a full year’s value out of a week.</p><cite>Charles Richard</cite></blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://jitha.substack.com/p/sunday-reads-164-how-much-would-you" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How much would you pay for a box that beeps!</a> – This article had interesting nuggets on how to pitch a product to the customer and set the price for it. It underscores the fact that customers don’t buy your product for its cutting-edge spec or features, they are buying it for solving their problem, so focus on the problem and you’ll never have to worry about lack of customers. This is applicable for everything that we do, day in and day out.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History</a> – How did one man’s effort or a specific business’s interest create a long standing health problem and environmental catastrophe of the modern world is the premise of this video. I personally learnt a lot of new and interesting things in the video. Some parts chemistry, some parts psychology and a bit of economics!</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I Listened</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/thriving-in-the-face-of-contradiction/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Thriving In The Face Of Contradiction</a> – Another good one from Hidden Brain. From the podcast excerpt &#8211; “<em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we’re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either/or choices. But psychologist <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/wendy-smith/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wendy Smith</a> says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap. She offers a different way to think about difficult choices, one that opens unexpected possibilities.”</em></p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings  </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://dev.to/jeroendedauw/advice-for-junior-developers-30am" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Advice for Junior Developers</a> – I wish I read this before talking to a bunch of junior devs a couple days ago. This article presents an important list of things that budding devs should start assimilating as part of their work. While many of us would feel this is intuitive, actioning it needs intentional practice.</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>

<h3><strong><em>Places I’ve Travelled</em></strong></h3>



<p>Completed a long pending trip to Sikkim &amp; Darjeeling with the family.&nbsp; I&#8217;d highly recommend this as a place to visit for your next vacation.

Did you know that Sikkim was an independent country/Kingdom until 1975 when it was officially annexed and made the 22nd state of India.&nbsp;<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOaG2S8tci_elc8ogyIvUJq8d0W5Y0seDuLR9eugvLR0hgy96lpLRkgnpCvJsCuyw?key=NzNRU2xJX0JhaERVc0lKVHp6OGRMNUxRME5LZUpB" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Here&#8217;s some photos from my trip.</a></p>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://humanparts.medium.com/how-to-deal-with-difficult-people-without-losing-your-mind-436540bbafbb" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How to deal with difficult people without losing your mind</a> – Conflicts are inevitable in all walks of life and having an approach that works for us and learning the alternatives  definitely helps. From the article &#8211; “<em>While most of us admit we are far less than perfect, we often find it quite difficult to accept others’ imperfection. If we are to handle difficult situations successfully, we must accept that people can be both flawed and fabulous</em>.”</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><em>Essays I’ve read</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://cnr.sh/essays/preventing-technology-turf-wars" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Preventing Technology Turf Wars</a> – Thanks to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grahamejastrebski" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Grahame</a></strong> for recommending <a href="https://cnr.sh/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Chris’s</a> writings. It’s amazing to see the kind of research and references on these Essays. I’ve found this one particularly interesting as many organizations are going through the exercise of improving efficiencies by consolidating functions.</p>
