<p><a href="https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Chesterton&#8217;s Fence &#8211; A Lesson in Second Order Thinking</a>&nbsp;– &nbsp;&nbsp;As Modernization, Reorganization, Consolidation etc. become part of our usual work vocabulary, it’s imperative we understand the importance of second order thinking. As the article points out &#8220;<em>A core component of making great decisions is understanding the rationale behind previous decisions. If we don’t understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse</em>&#8220;</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I’m watching</em></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Why Facts Don&#8217;t change Minds</a> – &nbsp;“<em>The way to change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to integrate them into your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now, they can change their beliefs without the risk of being abandoned socially</em>&#8221; &nbsp;&#8211; In this article, James talks about why facts don&#8217;t usually change minds and what does it take to get people to accept a different point of view</p>



<h3><strong><em>Documentaries I&#8217;m watching</em></strong></h3>



<p>&#8220;<em>Can we all become Geniuses</em>” (<a href="https://www.discoveryplus.in/videos/morgan-freemans-through-the-wormhole/can-we-all-become-geniuses?seasonId=7&amp;type=EPISODE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Discovery+)</a> &#8211; From the episode of &#8220;Through the Wormhole&#8221; narrated by Morgan Freeman &#8211; Genius lies somewhere in the human mind, bringing mathematical insight, sparking artistic inspiration and enabling some to see what most cannot. Might we augment our biology with technology to unlock the genius inside us all?</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/17/1058013/electric-planes-taking-off-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Electric Planes taking off challenges!</a> – Climate change is real and it&#8217;s interesting to see these technical advances that could potentially slowdown negative effects. Green Hydrogen and alternate fuels sound promising, but until we could find an economical way to produce them, decarbonizing travel is still seems far away.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_aaker_and_naomi_bagdonas_why_great_leaders_take_humor_seriously?language=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas: Why great leaders take humor seriously</a> – Thanks to <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwaryasankar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Aishwarya</a></strong> for sharing this video that talks about the surprising power of humour: why it&#8217;s a secret weapon to build bonds, power, creativity and resilience &#8212; and how we can all have more of it.</p>

<p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-emily-balcetis-tools-for-setting-and-achieving-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Dr. Emily Balcetis: Tools For Setting &amp; Achieving Goals</a> &#8211; This is long format science podcast I love and this episode talks about how visual perceptions can influence our level of motivation  and our emotional state as we pursue complex goals in life. One of the interesting things I learnt from this episode, that I&#8217;ve started using is the visual tools to keep track of progress. <a href="https://1se.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">1 Second Everyday</a> is slowly becoming part of my daily life.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings </em></strong></h3>

While Deepfake identification models are getting their own share of attention, I haven&#8217;t come across one in mainstream news.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-team-where-everyone-is-a-leader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">An Engineering team where everyone is a leader</a> – A very well written piece with practical tips for managers and leaders on how to build a team where each engineer is empowered to make decisions and leads from the front.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biNMRQJXvfs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Why No One Can Agree What’s REALLY the Tallest Mountain</a> – Did you know that the longest mountain range in earth is under sea and the tallest peak isn&#8217;t necessarily the Everest? There&#8217;s never a time when I have come out of a video from this channel without learning something new and also wondering how some of the simplest things we assume from our schooling can actually be very complex.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Books I’m (re) Reading</em></strong></h3>



<p>Reread my notes from the book  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Nudge</a> after listening to the recent episode of Hidden Brain on &#8220;<a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-2-0-how-to-see-yourself-clearly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How to see yourself clearly</a>&#8220;. The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">choice architecture</a> and its influence on people as described in Nudge made me think about comment from the podcast – “<em>We often make important decisions in our life and love for reasons we don&#8217;t even realize</em>”</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/why-firefox-deserves-its-sad-decline-1c44d9ba59c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Firefox and its sad decline&#8230;</a> – I love Firefox, but this is an example what happens to a product when there&#8217;s mis-timing, lack of customer focus and market understanding issues coupled with bad decisions. It&#8217;s sad to see Firefox fall from over 34% browser market share in 2010 to less than 3.5% currently.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Movies I watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9263550/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rocketry &#8211; The Nambi Effect</a> – (IMDb &#8211; 9.1) &#8211; After many months, this was a movie that shook me. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ActorMadhavan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">R.Madhavan</a> for making this and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambi_Narayanan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Dr. Nambi</a> an unsung hero who&#8217;s love for this country and passion for science has no parallels. What intrigued me when I watched this movie, is the impact media (news/television/social media etc.) has in creating a viral perception (right /wrong) about a person and how we as consumers embrace that without question and judge people. In an era of AI taking over content creation and propagation, it&#8217;s very important that each one of us have some moral and factual compass before coming to a judgement on piece of info we see out there.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32226910" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ask HN: I&#8217;m in a rut. How did you get out of yours?</a> – This active thread on HackerNews has lot of tips and discussions on how to handle and recover from Burnout and languishing. What intrigued me was, how a simple question when asked in a powerful forum could lead to tons of learning. Never be afraid to ask questions!</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I’m watching</em></strong></h3>



<p>As someone who personally struggles with initiating the first conversation, I found &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Zu5ZZAG7I" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">7 Ways to Make a Conversation with Anyone</a> very insightful and practical. It’s a beautiful TEDx talk that you’ll appreciate if you are working to get better at connecting and talking to someone.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/should-you-try-to-be-less-angry/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Should You Try to Be Less Angry?</a> – Another one from my favorite podcasts – “No Stupid Questions” where Angela and Stephen discuss about Anger and it effects. While it’s not always good to keep the pot boiling, Anger as evolutionary measure does come in handy in situations and it is important we learn more about how to tackle our emotions and understand its effects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently, I spoke to a group of new managers (mostly) and people who&#8217;ve transitioned from a Product/Program Management role about surprises that new people managers encounter. This talk was a drill down (albeit with a slight improvisation) on the research conducted by <a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=michael%20e.%20porter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Michael E. Porter,</a><a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=jay%20w.%20lorsch" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Jay W. Lorsch,</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=nitin%20nohria" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Nitin Nohria</a> which was outlined in their 2004 HBR article titled <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://hbr.org/2004/10/seven-surprises-for-new-ceos" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external"><em>Seven Surprises for New CEOs </em></a>. While the article dates back to 2004, the findings remain relevant even today.</p>



<p>While the original content was written with CEOs in mind, I&#8217;ve adapted that to managers at all levels given the audience of this networking session.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong><em>Management</em></strong> is both  <strong><em>Art</em></strong> and <strong><em>Science</em></strong>. It is <em>science</em> because there&#8217;s systemic study material, repeatable processes, and causality that can be learnt. It&#8217;s an Art because management requires a considerable amount of skill, practice, creativity and Individual application &#8211; what works for one may not work for another person. It&#8217;s therefore imperative to understand what one can expect as they embark on their management journey and chart a course for success. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with what new managers may find surprising as they embark on their management journey</p>



<br style="clear:left"><hr class="flaired">



<h3>You <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">can&#8217;t</mark> do everything</h3>



<p>As you enter management, you have to get comfortable with the feeling that you can&#8217;t be directly involved with everything that&#8217;s happening in your project / organization, yet you are fully accountable for outcomes &amp; results. This is in stark contrast to back when you were an individual contributor and now your time will be needed in more places than you can imagine.</p>



<p>To avoid/overcome problems with this surprise, you have to learn to</p>



<ol><li>Effectively <a href="#delegation">Delegate</a> to your direct reports and trust them</li><li>Manage your <a href="#timemanagement">time efficiently</a></li></ol>



<h3>You <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">can&#8217;t</mark> always tell people what to do</h3>



<p>You cannot micromanage every decision by telling people how to do things. Like Steve jobs said &#8220;<code><em>It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to to , We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do</em></code><strong><em>.</em>”</strong> We should enable people by providing the right amount of clarity on the needs and expectations around outcomes/ results and provide autonomy to execute.</p>



<p>Practice the following and you&#8217;ll steer clear and learn more</p>



<ul><li>Provide Clarity<ul><li>Set Vision &amp; Standards </li><li>Define operating principles (review cadence, stakeholder communication, cost etc)</li><li>Learn from mistakes (remember that we all learn from our mistakes, so create and embrace a culture where people can freely talk about failures and learnings from them)</li></ul></li><li>Avoid Decision Bottlenecks<ul><li>Share power and make people part of the decision making process. This can hugely improve trust.</li><li>Encourage the culture of calculated risk taking.</li><li>Learn and make use of <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://www.guru99.com/decision-making-tools.html" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Decision making tools</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>You <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">won&#8217;t</mark> always know what&#8217;s going on</h3>



<p>As a manager, you&#8217;ll have a lot of things going on around you (meetings, stakeholder management, planning, people issues, budgeting, hiring, performance management and tons more). Amidst all of that, it&#8217;s very difficult to keep track of every aspect of what&#8217;s happening. People won&#8217;t immediately be willing to give you the bad news, so by the time it gets to you, it may be late or have some glossy touches added.</p>



<p>But to manage effectively, you need to stay on top of things and be in the loop. Here are some thoughts on what can help you get there.</p>



<ul><li>Identify ways to collect as much information as possible about what&#8217;s happening in the team from different sources.<ul><li>Practice <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_wandering_around" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Management by walking around (MBWA)</a></li><li>Another alternate is <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba#:~:text=The%20Gemba%20Walk%20is%20an,results%20or%20make%20superficial%20comments." target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Gemba walk</a>, popularized by Toyota, where you walk to the place where the action happens, ask questions and learn.</li><li>Have skip level 1:1s and team meetings.</li></ul></li><li>Build strong partnerships with all your stakeholders<ul><li>Talk to your peers, customers, cross functional leaders, HR partners etc. This will give you a rounded perspective of what&#8217;s happening.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>You are always being <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">watched</mark>!</h3>



<p>I don&#8217;t&#8217; say this as something to be scared about, but as a manager/leader of the organization, you are always sending a message. The way you speak (or don’t speak!), your body language, choice of words, way to write, everything starts to matter now. People will try to read between lines and there are chances you can be misinterpreted.</p>



<p>To avoid potential issues because of this, try to</p>



<ul><li>Lead by example. Role model the behavior you would like to see in your team members. Your actions will soon be replicated in your team, so use it to your advantage.</li><li>Communicate clearly and ask for clarifications. Don&#8217;t assume people understood what you said.</li><li>Improve your self-awareness and Emotional Quotient</li><li>This is a continuous learning process, so you will have Blind spots. Get an <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://actionbuddy.io/blog/accountability-partner#:~:text=An%20accountability%20partner%20is%20someone,to%20stick%20to%20their%20commitments." target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">accountability partner</a> who can help provide feedback.</li></ul>



<h3>Organizational Politics is <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">real</mark>!</h3>



<p>Not all politics is bad. <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://opentext.wsu.edu/organizational-behavior/chapter/13-4-organizational-politics/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Organizational politics</a> is real and how well you deal with it will also define your success trajectory. <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/the-4-types-of-organizational-politics" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Studies show</a> that individuals with political skills tend to have a greater impact on organizational outcomes. Understanding and navigating organizational politics and improving your influencing authority will provide better outcomes for your teams.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" width="333" height="303" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png 329w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /><figcaption>Credits: Mindtools &#8211; <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_07.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Stakeholder Analysis</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Here are some thoughts about how to handle this</p>



<ul><li>Be Politically Savvy. What this means is that you are aware of what’s going on around you, you’re paying attention to the dynamics, paying attention to who has power and influence, and what the culture of your organization is, and you are positioning yourself successfully with all that information.</li><li>Build and leverage your network.</li><li>Understand your stakeholders and map them. <em>Power/interest grid for stakeholder prioritization</em> on the left can be one useful technique.</li></ul>



<div style="clear:right"></div>



<h3>You are still only <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">Human</mark>!</h3>



<p>You must remember that your position as a manager/leader does not automatically make you better or more capable. Like everyone else, you will learn from experience and the many mistakes that&#8217;ll provide important lessons along the way. However, as a manager, you have more accountability and responsibility, and how you role model your behaviors will be replicated.</p>



<p>It is essential to keep the following things in mind as you embark on your management/leadership journey.</p>



<ul><li>Your Work/Life balance is extremely important and how you manage it will be emulated by your team. Remember your mood will affect your team&#8217;s mood as well.<ul><li>A friend once gave me this priority list that I strive to follow &#8211; Health -> Family -> Relationships -> Work</li></ul></li><li>Being vulnerable and asking for help will improve trust with your teams and you&#8217;ll achieve more together.</li><li>Be Thankful, stay humble and praise generously.</li><li>Get a mentor/coach who can help you along the way and share their learnings.</li></ul>

<h4>Appendix</h4>



<ul id="delegation"><li><strong><em>Delegation</em></strong> is the assignment of authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is the process of distributing and entrusting work to another person, and therefore one of the core concepts of management leadership. The process involves managers deciding which work they should do themselves and which work should be delegated to others for completion.[1] From a managerial standpoint, delegation involves shifting project responsibility to team members, giving them the opportunity to finalize the work product effectively, with minimal intervention. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions. It is a shifting of decision-making authority as well as responsibility for the results from one organisational level to another lower one. However, a certain level of accountability for the outcome of the work does remain with the person who delegated the work to begin with.<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/how-to-delegate-effectively" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">How to Delegate Effectively</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1401615513998950401" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Radical Delegation by Shreyas Doshi</a></li></ul></li></ul>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-i-become-director-guru-bhat/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How can I become a Director? </a>&nbsp;– A very well written piece by Guru Bhat on what it takes to become a director. Eloquent as always, Guru hits the bulls eye on some key attributes that everyone should aspire to attain if they are on a quest for this title. I’ve been fortunate to learn by experience how “Bias for Action” can be a key differentiator in creating value for our stakeholders.</p>



<h3><strong><em>What worries me!</em></strong></h3>



<p>It’s hard to miss the series of natural calamities rocking the already pandemic struck world right now. From the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/19/google_oracle_cloud/?mc_cid=1674b3c928&amp;mc_eid=2b8cf1fb98" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">extreme heat waves in UK &amp; Europe</a> to <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2022/07/21/indias-monsoon-havoc-a-result-of-climate-change-experts-say/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Cloud bursts and Flash floods in India</a>, It’s time each one of us do our part to slow down climate change. <a href="https://medium.com/@cinthia.espino/why-is-0-5-c-so-important-3961b9989387" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Read this</a> if you want to know what a 0.5° Celsius change could mean to earth and <a href="https://coastal.climatecentral.org/map/10/72.9068/18.9721/?theme=sea_level_rise&amp;map_type=year&amp;basemap=roadmap&amp;contiguous=true&amp;elevation_model=best_available&amp;forecast_year=2040&amp;pathway=ssp3rcp70&amp;percentile=p50&amp;refresh=true&amp;return_level=return_level_0&amp;rl_model=gtsr&amp;slr_model=ipcc_2021_med" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">see these projections</a> of cities that would be under water if the sea-levels continues to rise.</p>

I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Places I’ve travelled.</em></strong></h3>



<p>I was in Bangalore this week meeting my colleagues in-person in office and wow, what a week it was. While there’s comfort &amp; some flexibility in working from home, nothing can beat the in-person collaboration and getting things done quickly. For me, Video calls somehow reduce the personal &amp; emotional side of the conversation. Looking forward to many more such visits and catching up with my people!</p>

But what if our assumptions about intelligence limit our potential? This week, psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman proposes a more expansive notion of what it means to be “smart</em>&#8220;.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>



<p><strong><em> </em></strong><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jul/9/gpt-3-explain-code/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Can GPT-3 explain how code works?</a> – I was amazed by the extent to which models like GPT-3 &amp; OpenAI Codex are getting increasingly efficient at writing code.
