<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-i-become-director-guru-bhat/">How can I become a Director? </a> – A very well written piece by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurubhat/">Guru Bhat</a> on what it takes to become a director. Eloquent as always, Guru hits the bulls eye on some key attributes that everyone should aspire to attain if they are on a quest for this title. I’ve been fortunate to learn by experience how “Bias for Action” can be a key differentiator in creating value for our stakeholders.</p>



<h3><strong><em>What worries me!</em></strong></h3>



<p>It’s hard to miss the series of natural calamities rocking the already pandemic struck world right now. From the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/19/google_oracle_cloud/?mc_cid=1674b3c928&amp;mc_eid=2b8cf1fb98">extreme heat waves in UK &amp; Europe</a> to <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2022/07/21/indias-monsoon-havoc-a-result-of-climate-change-experts-say/">Cloud bursts and Flash floods in India</a>, It’s time each one of us do our part to slow down climate change. <a href="https://medium.com/@cinthia.espino/why-is-0-5-c-so-important-3961b9989387">Read this</a> if you want to know what a 0.5° Celsius change could mean to earth and <a href="https://coastal.climatecentral.org/map/10/72.9068/18.9721/?theme=sea_level_rise&amp;map_type=year&amp;basemap=roadmap&amp;contiguous=true&amp;elevation_model=best_available&amp;forecast_year=2040&amp;pathway=ssp3rcp70&amp;percentile=p50&amp;refresh=true&amp;return_level=return_level_0&amp;rl_model=gtsr&amp;slr_model=ipcc_2021_med">see these projections</a> of cities that would be under water if the sea-levels continues to rise.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://tim.blog/2022/06/28/edward-o-thorp-2/">Master Investor Ed Thorp on How to think for yourself and many more topics</a> – This is a long format podcast but there&#8217;s some invaluable takeaways from Ed&#8217;s experience. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/24/ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future">ML Codegen Vs Coding by Hand</a> – In the previous musings I shared about auto code-gen and it got me intrigued into aspects that are debatable and why we should tread with care. This post explores some of this nuance and has a good further reading on other thoughts on the same topic as well</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you really think that the environment is less important than the economy, try holding your breath while you count your money.”</p><cite>Guy McPherson</cite></blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-i-become-director-guru-bhat/">How can I become a Director? </a> – A very well written piece by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurubhat/">Guru Bhat</a> on what it takes to become a director. Eloquent as always, Guru hits the bulls eye on some key attributes that everyone should aspire to attain if they are on a quest for this title. I’ve been fortunate to learn by experience how “Bias for Action” can be a key differentiator in creating value for our stakeholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, gardening has rapidly become a way to rejuvenate and is now a core family activity. Watching seeds germinate, flowers blossom, plants flourish(and sometimes dry out and die), I couldn’t help but draw parallels to management&nbsp;and the lessons we can learn from them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center has-small-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><strong><em>The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just on the body, but the soul. &#8211; </em></strong></mark><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><em>Alfred Austin</em></mark></strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:138px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="641" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-106" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil.jpeg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil-300x200.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil-768x513.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Soil &amp; Sunlight &#8211; It all starts here</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Every plant needs a specific type of soil to flourish. Clay, Sandy, Silty, or Peaty.&nbsp;There are many&nbsp;combinations depending on what plants you’ve got. Likewise, sunlight is also an important growth factor. Some plants need full sunlight, others need partial shade, while some grow remarkably well indoors with minimal light. Using the wrong soil type or lighting is a sure shot way to fail.</p>



<p>Like soil and&nbsp;sunlight form the foundation for the growth of plants, the right work assignments determine your team&#8217;s success.&nbsp;<em>New project features</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>fixing tech debt</em>&nbsp;<em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>support</em>&nbsp;<em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>building a product from scratch</em>, each needs a specific type of individual. Some are suited to platform work, some can learn new tech quickly and adapt to a fast-paced environment, some are very good at dealing with ambiguity, etc, so identify the right place for team members based on their skills, interests &amp; aspirations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:151px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-107" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/waterfert.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/waterfert.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/waterfert-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f3f2f2" class="has-inline-color">Water &amp; Fertilizer &#8211; Keep up the growth</mark></strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Now that you have foundations out of the way, let&#8217;s talk about regular care.</p>



<p>Water and fertilizer are two very important&nbsp;needs for a splendid garden. Every plant in your garden may have&nbsp;a specific need. Some don’t need any fertilizer for months, while others need it every week. Same with water. Some plants have&nbsp;to be watered daily and others are drought resistant and can sustain for weeks. Root rot, yellowing leaves, stunted growth, fertilizer burns, etc are very common issues you&#8217;ll see in gardening support forums and the only way to fix them is to fix your watering and fertilizing schedules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In management, this is like providing the right training, setting the right expectations, and following up on progress. Inadequate or incorrect training will create under-skilled members&nbsp;and frustrate the team.&nbsp;Lack of expectation setting and follow-up on progress will lead to suboptimal outcomes. Some team members do well with very minimal follow-up, whereas others will either need frequent follow-ups or someone to assist them continuously to ensure progress.&nbsp;<em>RCG&#8217;s, mid-level engineers, senior engineers, architects, managers</em>&nbsp;&#8211; each one has a different need and successful leaders should be mindful of these, spot opportunities, provide clarity for the team to flourish.</p>



<p>As a manager regularly ask yourself &#8211; Does your team have the right skills needed for the job? Do you micromanage a lot when you should let the team decide? Do you stay away from the action, only to pitch in when a crisis occurs?. Get your team&#8217;s feedback and adapt.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:96px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="264" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-102" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers-300x198.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="color:#fefdfd"><strong>Climbers need stability &amp; support</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>If you’ve grown flowering climbers (like Allamanda or morning glory) you may have noticed that beyond a certain height they can no longer grow without support. Strong Climbers sometimes use other branches in the same plant to continue growing, but even that has a limit.</p>



<p>The same is true for you and your team. Beyond a certain limit, they can no longer grow without leadership support. As a manager, always create the right support ecosystem both within and outside your teams. Find the right coaching / mentoring opportunities and share them. Have regular 1:1s and create an individual development plan which aligns with their aspirations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:119px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-105" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Seeds or stem cuttings &#8211; building next-gen</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>While you may have picked the best seeds or the strongest cuttings for propagation, you may never see a 100% success rate. Anything between 50-70% is a respectable success rate and you’ll eventually get better. Time is another important factor to consider too. Some seeds germinate quickly while others will take more time, don’t judge too soon, and start taking action.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll have similar observations during hiring as well. Someone fantastic during interviews&nbsp;can&nbsp;be inefficient at the job and an average person could&nbsp;be a rockstar. Give it time, observe progress at regular intervals, and course-correct accordingly. Don&#8217;t be too hard on yourself if you land a bad hire. Learn from it and move on. You&#8217;ll get better, eventually.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:96px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-104" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-large-font-size"><strong>Re-Potting &#8211; Moving on&#8230;</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>All plants eventually outgrow their containers. For you to sustain their growth and keep them from dying, you’ll need to move them to a larger pot with more soil/nutrients.</p>



<p>Likewise, in management, you should always watch out for successful people on your teams who are now ready for expanded roles, scope, etc, and create opportunities for them to grow. Depending on your situation, you may need to move them to other teams or, in some rare cases, even encourage them to look outside of the company. Remember, this is both good for the individual and the team. You don’t want cracked pots or stunted plants!</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:111px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="288" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-103" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning-300x216.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Pruning &#8211; It&#8217;s never easy</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Pruning boosts yields, improves aesthetics, reduces diseases &amp; prevents infestations. Every beautiful garden needs regular pruning. Don’t be afraid to prune &#8211; knowing when and how are important skills every gardener should learn.</p>



<p>Likewise, managers need&nbsp;to review their team structure periodically and make changes. You may have to remove misfits and underperformers, deliberately move out people who’ve been in your team for long to other teams, so they can grow (and your team can grow/adapt as well) or split teams into smaller units so they are more focused. Being a successful manager requires you to master these skills and know when the time is right to apply them.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><em><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">It’s important to realize that whether in plants or humans, growth is the same, and demands much of the same conditions and requirements. It’s hard work, takes a lot of effort and patience, but like a proud gardener admiring the beauty of their garden, seeing your team grow and succeed is both a rewarding and fulfilling part of being a manager.</span></em></pre>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>2 Kinds of Leaders</h2>



<ul><li><strong><em>Reward centered</em></strong><ol><li>They see the moving to leadership as a reward of what they’ve achieved so far and is a prize.</li><li>Focus on the &#8220;glory&#8221;, &#8220;prestige&#8221;, &#8220;rewards&#8221; for achieving pinnacle of success</li><li>They usually pick and choose what they want to do as leader and do what is usually something they feel they are good at or have fun.</li></ol></li><li><strong><em>Responsibility centered</em></strong><ol type="i"><li>Look at this as a responsibility rather than reward.</li><li>Don’t shy away from doing what is required for someone at this job</li><li>The experience of being &#8216;<em>responsibility centered</em>&#8216; leader should be tough and challenging</li><li>Look at this from the perspective of the people they lead, rather than themselves.</li></ol></li></ul>



<ul><li>There&#8217;s no pure &#8220;Reward&#8221; / &#8220;Responsibility&#8221; focused Leader. People are usually in a spectrum. You need to ensure you are more aligned toward Responsibility centered.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Responsibility centered Leaders need to be aware of the <strong>Trap</strong> &#8211; when they are being responsibility centered leader, people tend to praise them and agree with them quite a lot and this can lead people to move down the path of Reward centered leadership.<ul><li>Have a strong inner circle who can challenge and keep them honest</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2><strong>5 Core responsibilities</strong> </h2>



<p>These are responsibilities that &#8220;<em>Reward centered</em>&#8221; Leaders usually ignore or don&#8217;t do well</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>Having difficult &amp; uncomfortable conversations</em></strong><ul><li>Addressing Bad behavior immediately and not tolerating regardless of how good the direct report is at their job</li><li>Don&#8217;t avoid these hard conversations</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Managing subordinates</em></strong><ul><li>Individual coaching and guidance is necessary at all levels. This has got nothing to do with the person&#8217;s experience.</li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color"><em>If you feel you should be able to trust people to manage themselves, or justify not knowing what your direct reports are doing by justifying not being a micromanager, then your motive for leading is wrong.</em></span></li><li><strong><em>Micromanagement</em></strong> &#8212; <span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">the only people who call management, micromanagement are the ones trying to avoid accountability</span>.</li><li><strong>As a leader, you need to</strong><ul><li>Know what they are working on</li><li>Know their progress</li><li>Give them the right feedback and coaching</li></ul></li><li>Lots of experience doesn&#8217;t mean people don&#8217;t have to be managed. It&#8217;s not sign of punishment or lack of trust. It&#8217;s giving them the benefit of direction and coaching.</li><li>Best of sportsmen pay people to coach them.</li><li>Stopping managing is a sign of neglect.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Running great team meetings</em></strong><ul><li>Running boring meetings / avoiding them</li><li>Outcome based meetings</li><li>If you allow in-effective meetings to happens, this will percolate to entire org</li><li><strong><em>Bad Meetings == Bad decisions</em></strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Developing Leadership team</em></strong><ul><li>If you feel this is something touchy-feely and waste of time, then your motive for being a leader isn&#8217;t right.</li><li>Hiring != delegating to HR</li><li>It&#8217;s not just a annual meeting or gala for team building</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Communicating constantly &amp; repeatedly</em></strong><ul><li>Research says it takes <strong>7 times</strong> for people to hear the same message before believe execs are serious about it.</li><li><strong>CEOs need to be Chief Reminding Officers</strong></li><li>You always need to over communicate.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>Quotes &amp; References</h2>



<ul><li><em>It’s about doing the job, not having the job.</em></li><li><em>CEO is not Chief Executive Officer , it is Chief </em><strong><em>Executing</em></strong><em> officer.</em></li><li><em>When deciding on picking up a certain role ask yourself</em><ul><li><strong><em>Why do you want to do the thing that __ does?

He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him?</em></li></ul></li></ul>

This was suggested for use in the case of anxiety or phobias, in which humor and ridicule can be used when fear is paralyzing. For example, a person with a fear of looking foolish might be encouraged to try to look foolish on purpose. Paradoxically, the fear would be removed when the intention involved the thing that was feared most.</li><li>Reversal of attitude by replacing fear with a paradoxical wish<ul><li><em>&#8220;Paradoxical intention can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessness12 results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.&#8221;</em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Socratic Dialogue</em></strong><ul><li>Help someone realize the answer to their question / self discovery through the use of their own words</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>No-o Dynamics</strong><ul><li>Man&#8217;s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium.
