										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, gardening has rapidly become a way to rejuvenate and is now a core family activity. Watching seeds germinate, flowers blossom, plants flourish(and sometimes dry out and die), I couldn’t help but draw parallels to management&nbsp;and the lessons we can learn from them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center has-small-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><strong><em>The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just on the body, but the soul. &#8211; </em></strong></mark><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><em>Alfred Austin</em></mark></strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:138px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="641" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-106" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil.jpeg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil-300x200.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil-768x513.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Soil &amp; Sunlight &#8211; It all starts here</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Every plant needs a specific type of soil to flourish. Clay, Sandy, Silty, or Peaty.&nbsp;There are many&nbsp;combinations depending on what plants you’ve got. Likewise, sunlight is also an important growth factor. Some plants need full sunlight, others need partial shade, while some grow remarkably well indoors with minimal light. Using the wrong soil type or lighting is a sure shot way to fail.</p>



<p>Like soil and&nbsp;sunlight form the foundation for the growth of plants, the right work assignments determine your team&#8217;s success.&nbsp;<em>New project features</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>fixing tech debt</em>&nbsp;<em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>support</em>&nbsp;<em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>building a product from scratch</em>, each needs a specific type of individual. Some are suited to platform work, some can learn new tech quickly and adapt to a fast-paced environment, some are very good at dealing with ambiguity, etc, so identify the right place for team members based on their skills, interests &amp; aspirations.</p>

</div></div>



<p>Now that you have foundations out of the way, let&#8217;s talk about regular care.</p>



<p>Water and fertilizer are two very important&nbsp;needs for a splendid garden. Every plant in your garden may have&nbsp;a specific need. Some don’t need any fertilizer for months, while others need it every week. Same with water. Some plants have&nbsp;to be watered daily and others are drought resistant and can sustain for weeks. Root rot, yellowing leaves, stunted growth, fertilizer burns, etc are very common issues you&#8217;ll see in gardening support forums and the only way to fix them is to fix your watering and fertilizing schedules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In management, this is like providing the right training, setting the right expectations, and following up on progress. Inadequate or incorrect training will create under-skilled members&nbsp;and frustrate the team.&nbsp;Lack of expectation setting and follow-up on progress will lead to suboptimal outcomes. Some team members do well with very minimal follow-up, whereas others will either need frequent follow-ups or someone to assist them continuously to ensure progress.&nbsp;<em>RCG&#8217;s, mid-level engineers, senior engineers, architects, managers</em>&nbsp;&#8211; each one has a different need and successful leaders should be mindful of these, spot opportunities, provide clarity for the team to flourish.</p>



<p>As a manager regularly ask yourself &#8211; Does your team have the right skills needed for the job? Do you micromanage a lot when you should let the team decide? Do you stay away from the action, only to pitch in when a crisis occurs?. Get your team&#8217;s feedback and adapt.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:96px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="264" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-102" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers-300x198.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="color:#fefdfd"><strong>Climbers need stability &amp; support</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>If you’ve grown flowering climbers (like Allamanda or morning glory) you may have noticed that beyond a certain height they can no longer grow without support. Strong Climbers sometimes use other branches in the same plant to continue growing, but even that has a limit.</p>



<p>The same is true for you and your team. Beyond a certain limit, they can no longer grow without leadership support. As a manager, always create the right support ecosystem both within and outside your teams. Find the right coaching / mentoring opportunities and share them. Have regular 1:1s and create an individual development plan which aligns with their aspirations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:119px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-105" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Seeds or stem cuttings &#8211; building next-gen</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>While you may have picked the best seeds or the strongest cuttings for propagation, you may never see a 100% success rate. Anything between 50-70% is a respectable success rate and you’ll eventually get better. Time is another important factor to consider too. Some seeds germinate quickly while others will take more time, don’t judge too soon, and start taking action.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll have similar observations during hiring as well. Someone fantastic during interviews&nbsp;can&nbsp;be inefficient at the job and an average person could&nbsp;be a rockstar. Give it time, observe progress at regular intervals, and course-correct accordingly. Don&#8217;t be too hard on yourself if you land a bad hire. Learn from it and move on. You&#8217;ll get better, eventually.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:96px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-104" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">

</div></div>



<p>All plants eventually outgrow their containers. For you to sustain their growth and keep them from dying, you’ll need to move them to a larger pot with more soil/nutrients.</p>



<p>Likewise, in management, you should always watch out for successful people on your teams who are now ready for expanded roles, scope, etc, and create opportunities for them to grow. Depending on your situation, you may need to move them to other teams or, in some rare cases, even encourage them to look outside of the company. Remember, this is both good for the individual and the team. You don’t want cracked pots or stunted plants!</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:111px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="288" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-103" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning-300x216.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Pruning &#8211; It&#8217;s never easy</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Pruning boosts yields, improves aesthetics, reduces diseases &amp; prevents infestations. Every beautiful garden needs regular pruning. Don’t be afraid to prune &#8211; knowing when and how are important skills every gardener should learn.</p>



<p>Likewise, managers need&nbsp;to review their team structure periodically and make changes. You may have to remove misfits and underperformers, deliberately move out people who’ve been in your team for long to other teams, so they can grow (and your team can grow/adapt as well) or split teams into smaller units so they are more focused. Being a successful manager requires you to master these skills and know when the time is right to apply them.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><em><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">It’s important to realize that whether in plants or humans, growth is the same, and demands much of the same conditions and requirements. It’s hard work, takes a lot of effort and patience, but like a proud gardener admiring the beauty of their garden, seeing your team grow and succeed is both a rewarding and fulfilling part of being a manager.</span></em></pre>

<h2>2 Kinds of Leaders</h2>



<ul><li><strong><em>Reward centered</em></strong><ol><li>They see the moving to leadership as a reward of what they’ve achieved so far and is a prize.</li><li>Focus on the &#8220;glory&#8221;, &#8220;prestige&#8221;, &#8220;rewards&#8221; for achieving pinnacle of success</li><li>They usually pick and choose what they want to do as leader and do what is usually something they feel they are good at or have fun.</li></ol></li><li><strong><em>Responsibility centered</em></strong><ol type="i"><li>Look at this as a responsibility rather than reward.</li><li>Don’t shy away from doing what is required for someone at this job</li><li>The experience of being &#8216;<em>responsibility centered</em>&#8216; leader should be tough and challenging</li><li>Look at this from the perspective of the people they lead, rather than themselves.</li></ol></li></ul>



<ul><li>There&#8217;s no pure &#8220;Reward&#8221; / &#8220;Responsibility&#8221; focused Leader. People are usually in a spectrum. You need to ensure you are more aligned toward Responsibility centered.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Responsibility centered Leaders need to be aware of the <strong>Trap</strong> &#8211; when they are being responsibility centered leader, people tend to praise them and agree with them quite a lot and this can lead people to move down the path of Reward centered leadership.<ul><li>Have a strong inner circle who can challenge and keep them honest</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2><strong>5 Core responsibilities</strong> </h2>



<p>These are responsibilities that &#8220;<em>Reward centered</em>&#8221; Leaders usually ignore or don&#8217;t do well</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>Having difficult &amp; uncomfortable conversations</em></strong><ul><li>Addressing Bad behavior immediately and not tolerating regardless of how good the direct report is at their job</li><li>Don&#8217;t avoid these hard conversations</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Managing subordinates</em></strong><ul><li>Individual coaching and guidance is necessary at all levels. This has got nothing to do with the person&#8217;s experience.</li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color"><em>If you feel you should be able to trust people to manage themselves, or justify not knowing what your direct reports are doing by justifying not being a micromanager, then your motive for leading is wrong.</em></span></li><li><strong><em>Micromanagement</em></strong> &#8212; <span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">the only people who call management, micromanagement are the ones trying to avoid accountability</span>.</li><li><strong>As a leader, you need to</strong><ul><li>Know what they are working on</li><li>Know their progress</li><li>Give them the right feedback and coaching</li></ul></li><li>Lots of experience doesn&#8217;t mean people don&#8217;t have to be managed. It&#8217;s not sign of punishment or lack of trust. It&#8217;s giving them the benefit of direction and coaching.</li><li>Best of sportsmen pay people to coach them.</li><li>Stopping managing is a sign of neglect.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Running great team meetings</em></strong><ul><li>Running boring meetings / avoiding them</li><li>Outcome based meetings</li><li>If you allow in-effective meetings to happens, this will percolate to entire org</li><li><strong><em>Bad Meetings == Bad decisions</em></strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Developing Leadership team</em></strong><ul><li>If you feel this is something touchy-feely and waste of time, then your motive for being a leader isn&#8217;t right.</li><li>Hiring != delegating to HR</li><li>It&#8217;s not just a annual meeting or gala for team building</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Communicating constantly &amp; repeatedly</em></strong><ul><li>Research says it takes <strong>7 times</strong> for people to hear the same message before believe execs are serious about it.</li><li><strong>CEOs need to be Chief Reminding Officers</strong></li><li>You always need to over communicate.</li></ul></li></ul>

He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person?

To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.&#8221;</em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Socratic Dialogue</em></strong><ul><li>Help someone realize the answer to their question / self discovery through the use of their own words</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>No-o Dynamics</strong><ul><li>Man&#8217;s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed listening to Gaur Gopal Das speak and this time, <em><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">How to find Balance and Purpose in Life</span></em>, an attractive minor heading got me hooked to this book.</p>



<p>Gaur Gopal Das draws an analogy to wheels of a car and states that the secret of Life is finding the balance and just like a car balances on 4 wheels, we must balance 4 critical aspects/areas of Life.</p>



<ol class="has-medium-font-size"><li><em><strong>Personal Life</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Relationships</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Work Life</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Social contribution</strong></em></li></ol>



<p>Furthermore, <strong><em>Balance</em></strong> is split into 2 kinds :</p>



<p><strong><em>External Balancing (alignment)</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Adjust priorities based on the situation at the moment and focusing on that particular wheel that needs attention.</li><li>Tenets are <strong><em>Balance</em></strong> and <strong><em>Adjustment</em></strong></li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Internal Balancing</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>This is about our attitude and values, more like air in the tyres &#8211; If the air pressure is not right, there&#8217;ll be puncture.</li><li>Tenets are <strong><em>Attitude</em></strong> and <strong><em>values</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Sprituality</em></strong> is another important aspect mentioned in this book and going back to Car analogy, this is compared as being the steering wheel. Even if you have all wheels of the car balanced and aligned with the right air pressure, not having the steering wheel means you&#8217;ll never reach the destination.</p>



<ul><li>In whatever genuine form, spirituality brings purpose to our life and gives a destination worth going</li><li>Comprised of 4 pieces (4 S&#8217;s) &#8211; <strong><em>Spiritual Practice</em></strong> (<em>Sadhana</em>), <strong><em>Company we keep</em></strong> (<em>Sangha</em>), <strong><em>Our Character</em></strong> (<em>Sadachar</em>), <strong>Our service to god &amp; </strong><strong><em>others</em></strong> (<em>Seva</em>)</li><li>When all these 4 are aligned properly we&#8217;ll be able to drive the car of our life to its destination</li></ul>



<h2>Wheel #1 &#8211; Personal Life</h2>



<h3><strong><em>Expressing Gratitude</em></strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em>See the Positive</em></strong><ul><li>We all boil at different degrees!</li><li>I am not saying these problems don’t exist, but the real problem is that when negativity consumes the mind, not only do we lose the vision to see the beautiful things around us, but also the ability to solve the problems that confront us.</li><li><strong><em>We have to train our mind to focus on the positive and feel empowered to deal with the negative.</em></strong></li><li>When we think negatively of people, we should immediately counteract that energy by contemplating three positive qualities they have</li><li>Episode of the <strong><em>cumin seed stuck in teeth</em></strong> &#8211; Mind is the like the tongue, it drifts towards negative areas of Life, making us restless and uneasy. It schemes to uproot the problems that&#8217;s causing pain, not realising that persistent scheming causes more emotional damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Gratitude is not a feeling</em></strong>; it is a state of mind that can be developed, and it allows us to tap into a reservoir of unlimited positive energy.</li><li><strong><em>Being grateful happens in two steps.</em></strong><ol><li>The first is to realize that there is good in the world and that good has fallen upon us.</li><li>The second is to know that goodness is coming from something other than us, an external reality is giving the gifts of grace to our very own reality. This could be our family, our friends, nature and even God. We have so much to be grateful for!</li></ol></li><li>Even in times of difficulty and sorrow, we can feel the inner strength, when we are grateful for the support of caring friends and family.</li><li><strong><em>How to express gratitude</em></strong><ul><li><strong><em>Recognize</em></strong> the good that has been done to us and say Thank you</li><li><strong><em>Remember </em></strong>what good was done and mean the Thank You!<ul><li>Contemplation is the best methods to develop gratitude.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Reciprocate</em></strong> Live the Thank You- through your actions and give back.</li><li><strong>Gratitude Log</strong><ul><li>Reflect on the last 24 hours and identify 3-5 people or situation that you are grateful for</li><li>Be very descriptive so it becomes easy to excavate the emotion from you.</li><li>Once every week, it should also contain 3-5 action points to thank people you are grateful for.</li><li>When doing this feel the happiness you felt when the good was done to you.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><strong><em>Press Pause</em></strong></h3>

<h3><strong><em>Why Worry</em></strong></h3>

<ul><li>Learning to detach ourselves from situations outside of our control is an imperative skill to learn for personal growth.</li><li>This doesn&#8217;t mean you should be lazy &#8211; we should do everything in our power to rectify the situation, but after that we should take our attention away from the unpleasant circumstance.</li><li>What we see as bad at one point in time may turn out to be good for us and, what we see as good at another point may turn out to be bad for us. We should not judge the situation by its face value.</li><li>Sometimes when we get engrossed in a problem, we feel trapped in our own minds. In that state, we constantly regurgitate our issues, causing us a lot of emotional pain. A spiritual process gives us the ability to come out of this mental loop and helps transform the greatest difficulties into opportunities.’</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h3><em>Importance of Meditation</em></h3>



<ul><li>Takes time and needs discipline. All the more important for people who feel they don&#8217;t have the time.</li><li>Like a plane, takes us high, far away and further away imperceptibly. If you look out of a window, you don&#8217;t seem like moving fast, but later you realize how far you&#8217;ve come.</li><li>Allows experience of self realization.</li></ul>



<h2>Wheel #2 : Relationships</h2>



<h3><em>Be sensitive with our words and actions</em></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">Fight the strong urge to judge someone based on an initial interaction with them</span></em></strong>. Everyone has a fascinating story that we know nothing about.</li><li>Being attentive in our relationships is crucial to our success. How we behave towards others determines the quality of our life. ‘<strong><em>It’s just my personality</em></strong>’ is not an acceptable excuse to be insensitive towards others.</li><li><strong><em>Golden Rule</em></strong> : Treat someone better than how you&#8217;d want to be treated. Ask the question &#8211; &#8220;Does my tone of voice, body language, behavior reflect sensitivity&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;<em><strong>Familiarity breeds contempt </strong>&#8211; </em>When we are overly familiar with people, we forget how important they are to us and the correct way to behave with them&#8221;</li><li><strong><em>Attitude doesn&#8217;t discriminate</em></strong> &#8211; Treating inanimate objects with insensitivity will gradually leads us to treating everyone the same way.</li></ul>



<h3><em>Look at the Positives</em></h3>



<ul><li>Always see the best in people &#8211; Like a bee that always looks for flowers with nectar and avoid lingering where there&#8217;s dirt.</li><li>5 different ways to perceive people in our relationships.<ol type="1"><li><em><b>Person who cannot see the Good at all&nbsp; (e.g </b></em><strong><em>neighbours dirty clothes &amp; window)</em></strong><ul><li>This kind only sees the bad and magnifies it out of proportion</li><li>Possible reasons maybe &#8211; spite, dislike, insecurity</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Person who sees both Good and Bad, but chooses to neglect the Good (e.g dog that shopped and forgot the keys)</em></strong><ul><li>Happens so often &#8211; Our friends and family, do so much but we neglect and focus only on the bad things.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Person who sees both Good and Bad and is neutral to both</em></strong><ul><li>Difficult to find this type &#8211; they are indifferent to everything and don&#8217;t care much for anything.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Person who sees both Good and Bad and consciously chooses to neglect the Bad</em></strong><ul><li>Really tough to live this as it requires you to consciously avoid the natural human tendency to focus on the bad.</li><li>E.g Aditya Birla &#8211; Speaking tree employee who caused a huge loss, started by making a list &#8211;&nbsp; <strong><em>&#8220;Points in favour of this employee&#8221;</em></strong> to create the conscious attention to shift focus to positive. This set the tone for the leadership behavior.</li><li><strong><em>Before you decide to reprimand someone, sit down and write a list</em></strong> of all good qualities they have &#8211; though it may not change your ultimate decision, it may change your perspective about the situation and help control anger</li><li><strong><em>Focus on the good and deal with the bad</em></strong> &#8211; is a principle that help save relationships and help make the right decision.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Person who cannot see the Bad at all; they see the slightest good and magnify it</em></strong><ul><li>Only possible for God or an enlightened one.</li><li>Can be impractical for us most of time.</li><li><strong><em>Neglecting the bad doesn&#8217;t mean that we do not deal with it practically &#8211; It just means that we do not allow our mind to focus on and hover over the bad.</em></strong></li></ul></li></ol></li></ul>



<h3><em><strong>Correcting Cautiously</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li>Learning the art of appreciation is vital for building healthy relationship.</li><li><strong><em>Mutual Funds &amp; Relationships have one thing in common &#8211; You must invest in them before you can withdraw</em></strong> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li>We should learn to invest appreciation and love into a person before we correct them. If not done this way, the person receiving the feedback will feel demotivated and not cherished.</li><li><strong><em>Art of giving feedback</em></strong> &#8211; just having the right intention is not enough. Giving advice inappropriately may do more harm than good. <em><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color"><strong>It&#8217;s not what you said, it&#8217;s how you said it. Tone of the voice, body language and facial expression account for more than words too</strong>.</span></em></li><li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">4 questions before giving feedback</span></strong><ol type="1"><li><strong><em>Am I the right person to give corrective feedback?</em></strong> &#8211; Is someone else better suited, am I a friend? Am I an authority in the subject?</li><li><strong><em>Do I have the right motive to give corrective feedback</em></strong><ul><li>Desires govern what we want and motives tell us why we want it</li><li>We should be conscientious that our motive to give feedback is appropriate&nbsp; &#8211; or is it the case of settling old accounts, grudge or to exact vengeance.</li><li>Feedback from the place of love may be unpalatable, but it tastes the sweetest if done appropriately and has the right effect.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Do I know the right way to give corrective feedback</strong><ul><li><em>People are usually resilient. <span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">They can stand being wrong, but only when it is pointed out to them with love. Being blunt and abusive can be emotionally draining for both, and the person receiving the feedback switches off after some time.</span></em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Is it the right time?</strong><ul><li>Hot heads don&#8217;t give good feedback &#8211; Choose a better time.</li><li>We should not simply let our anger loose &#8211; we should explain it. When we express what we feel, we do so at the risk of seeming unpleasant, but when we take the time to explain our emotions to people, they might be able to empathize with us.</li></ul></li></ol></li></ul>



<h3><em><strong>Forgiveness</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">In this fast paced world, we no longer bother with the subtle intricacies and niceties in our relationships &#8211; we think about people in terms of their purpose and utility and our interactions are driven by it.</mark></li><li>Everything in this world is instant &#8211; Sadly it doesn&#8217;t work like that for our relationships.</li><li><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How to practice forgiveness</span></strong><ul><li><strong><em>Look beyond the situation</em></strong> &#8211;<ul><li>We&#8217;ve all be in situations where our intellect is clouded by emotions. At those times we say anything and everything for our own peace of mind. Although a moment of patience in a moment of anger can save us a thousand moments of regret in the future, usually when we are suffering intensely, we cannot help but let our minds run amok.</li><li>Think &#8211;  How are they suffering? What are they feeling? Is there a deeper chaos?</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Separate the episode from the Person</em></strong><ul><li><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">Start with language we use to describe the incident</mark><ul><li>Saying &#8220;<strong>It is my problem</strong>&#8221; causes us to feel guilty and over time it may cause inferiority complex.</li><li>Saying &#8220;<strong>It is your problem</strong>&#8221;  causes us to feel angry &#8211; you can never say those words peacefully.</li><li>Saying &#8220;<strong>It is the problem</strong>&#8221; &#8211; separates the problem from the person and helps deal with it effectively.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Focus on the higher purpose</em></strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Forgiveness vs Justice</strong><ul><li>On a personal level, you can forgive a person who has wronged us, but on a societal level, there should be strict justice to create an orderly society. No one should be able to break away with the law in the name of forgiveness.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><em><strong>Associations</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">Association (called Sangha in sanskrit) is crucial to your success in this world and beyond.</mark></li><li>We are known by the company we keep (funny story about handsome man and excretion)</li><li>Association is beyond neutral dealings &#8211; Level of intimacy<ul><li><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/dadati"><em>dadāti</em></a>—gives charity; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/pratigrhnati"><em>pratigṛhṇāti</em></a>—accepts in return; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/guhyam"><em>guhyam</em></a><em>—</em>confidential topics; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/akhyati"><em>ākhyāti</em></a>—explains; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/prcchati"><em>pṛcchati</em></a>—enquires; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/bhunkte"><em>bhuṅkte</em></a><em>—</em>eats; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/bhojayate"><em>bhojayate</em></a>—feeds; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/ca"><em>ca</em></a>—also; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/eva"><em>eva</em></a>—certainly; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/sat"><em>ṣaṭ</em></a><em>&#8211;</em><a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/vidham"><em>vidham</em></a>—six kinds; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/priti"><em>prīti</em></a>—of love; <a href="https://prabhupadabooks.com/d/laksanam"><em>lakṣaṇam</em></a>—symptoms.</li></ul></li><li>Association creates sub-conscious sharing of value systems (e.g smoker vs non-smoking friend and consequence)</li><li><em><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">&#8220;Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny.&#8221;</mark></em></li></ul>



<h2>Wheel #3 : Work Life</h2>



<h3><em><strong>Competition Crossroads</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li>Causes of Unhealthy Competition &#8211; Being envious or uncontrolled ambition</li><li>We compete with people who have same skills or outlook in life, otherwise we don&#8217;t feel threatened.</li><li>Competition is everywhere.</li><li><strong>Jealousy or Envy</strong><ul><li>When one harbours ill feelings towards others wanting to be like them or better than them but does not act on those feelings, it is called jealousy.</li><li>When one acts on those ill feelings jealousy turns into envy</li></ul></li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color"><strong><em>If we do have to compare ourselves with others, we should compare positive attitudes. That person’s attitude to tirelessly keep working or grinding at their skills is inspiring. I want that same attitude. Let me learn from them and in turn help them in any way I can. Let us mutually grow. That is how a an open-minded person thinks.</em></strong></span></li><li>Healthy Competition is about competing with ourselves rather than others</li><li>There&#8217;ll always be workplace politics and we should learn to manage it in a clean way.</li></ul>



<h3><em><strong>Self Discovery</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li><em>We should understand ourselves to know what&#8217;s meaningful for us and what we want to spend our time on</em></li><li><em><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">If there is one thing that I think is the foundation of growth, it is understanding who you are. You can only compete with yourself if you have a clear idea of your potential, your capacities and certainly your limitation</span></em></li><li>Everyone has been gifted with special talents and skills. Every individual has something unique in them. If God were to reveal that talent to us straight away, from the very day we were born, there would be no excitement in our journey. God covers our talent, skills and potential only so that we have the chance to discover it. And in the process of doing so, in trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives, there is a tremendous sense of satisfaction</li><li>Self Discovery is not a one-time event, but an ongoing evolution.</li></ul>

<h3><em><strong>Sprituality @ work</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li>To be ambitious and entrepreneurial for yourself is not wrong.</li><li>It&#8217;s a misconception to think spirituality kills ambition and zest to achieve.</li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color"><strong><em>Spirituality changes your motive to achieve and makes us want more so we can have the resources to help others.</em></strong></span></li><li>Another misconception is that spiritual people get walked over in business because of their values (e.g <strong><em>sage and snake story</em></strong>). <strong><em>Spirituality teaches us to stick to values but at the same time be meticulous and straightforward in business.</em></strong></li><li>You can make as much money as you want/desire, but be wary of it&#8217;s potential to distract us from our purpose.</li></ul>



<h3><em><strong>Integrity &amp; Character</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li>Good character has the ability to change lives.</li><li>Philosophy without character is of no value.</li><li>3 aspects of spirituality in practice.<ul><li><strong>Vichaar</strong>: The philosophy that we seek answers from. This helps us understand how life should be lived, and how spirituality should be practised. These concepts, in turn, are the universal lighthouse principles that guide us towards living a life of value.</li><li><strong>Aachaar</strong>: Based on the philosophy is the physical action which leads to a transformation in our value system and helps us develop good conduct and character. When one’s character is transformed by following even a sentence of the rich philosophy, then those actions are called aachaar.</li><li><strong>Prachaar</strong>: The good conduct of a spiritual practitioner inspires others to have faith in the philosophy and values of spirituality. Without having to give a single sermon, we can reach out to many just by being exemplary and having good character. <strong><em>What great men do, common men follow</em></strong>.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2>Wheel #4 : Social Contributions</h2>



<h3><em><strong>Selfless Sacrifice</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">Ice-cream and Candle both melt</span></em></strong> &#8211; but there reasons are different. Ice-cream represents the desire to savour every moment of your life through personal enjoyment, whereas candle&#8217;s very essence is to give light to others.</li><li><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">Oxygen mask&nbsp; in flight &#8211; use it yourself before you help others</span></em></strong>.<ul><li>We can only share wealth with others if we possess wealth. Similarly, we can love others only if we know what it feels like to be loved. We can only bring hope to others if we feel hope for ourselves. In conclusion, we can only give to others what we possess</li><li>If you don&#8217;t follow this you&#8217;ll land into <strong><em>compassion fatigue</em></strong>.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><em><strong>Family First</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li>Relationships at home can work well only if all parties have low expectations of each other, but high expectations of themselves to help the other.</li><li>Example of Lata Bhagawan Khare &#8211; who ran Marathon barefoot to save her husband.</li></ul>



<h3><em><strong>Nation Narrative</strong></em></h3>



<ul><li>Expand the circle of selflessness slowly so we can effectively serve our community and nation.</li><li>Love for God is composed of 3 things<ul><li><strong>Right Action</strong> &#8211; behave and act in accordance with spiritual principles</li><li><strong>Right Intention</strong> &#8211; Have selfless intention. Continuously checking our intentions makes them pure.</li><li><strong>Right Mood</strong>&nbsp; &#8211; Serve in a way that&#8217;s favourable for our growth. Don&#8217;t do it because &#8220;You have to&#8221; but because &#8220;it&#8217;s the right thing to do&#8221;</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3><em>Rule #1 &#8211; Don&#8217;t follow your passion</em></h3>

<ul><li><strong><em>Passion is rare</em></strong><ul><li>2002 study Robert Vallerand in Canadian Universities found that though 84% had a passion, <strong><em>less than 4% of it had any relation to work of education</em></strong> while the remaining 96% was more of describing a hobby.</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li><strong><em>Craftsman Mindset</em></strong> (<em>Focuses on what you can offer the world. &#8211; offers clarity</em>) <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">VS</span></strong> <strong><em>Passion Mindset</em></strong> ( Focuses on what the world can offer you &#8212; Offers swamp of ambiguous &amp; unanswerable questions.)<ul><li>If you focus on what this work offers you, you are increasingly aware of what you don&#8217;t like about it and it causes unhappiness.</li><li>Also finding answers to questions like &#8220;Who am I&#8221;,&nbsp; &#8220;What do I truly like doing&#8221; etc don&#8217;t have straight answers</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting a craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you&#8217;ll build a compelling career.</em></strong></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Career Capital</strong><ul><li><strong><em>Traits that define great work</em></strong><ul><li><strong><em>Creativity &#8211; </em></strong><em>How can this be done in a way that&#8217;s completely out of box</em></li><li><strong><em>Impact (Mission) &#8211; </em></strong><em>How does this work impact you and the society</em></li><li><strong><em>Control &#8211; </em></strong><em>How much flexibility do you have in how you accomplish your work</em></li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Career Capital Theory</em></strong><ul><li><em>Traits that define great work are rare and valuable.</em></li><li><em>Supply &amp; Demand says that if you want a job that has those traits, you need to have something rare and valuable to offer in return. &#8211; This is your </em><strong><em>career capital</em></strong></li><li><strong><em>Craftsman Mindset </em></strong><em>is well suited to acquire this career capital.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong><em>3 disqualifiers where you can&#8217;t apply Craftsman Mindset</em></strong><ul><li>Job presents fewer opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing skills.</li><li>Job focusses on something you think is useless or perhaps even bad for the world.</li><li>Job forces you to work with people you really dislike.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>How to build Career Capital</em></strong><ul><li><strong><em>Deliberate Practice </em></strong>coined by Anders Ericsson &#8211; <em>Activity designed, typically by a teacher for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individuals performance.</em></li><li><strong><em>The 10,000 Hour Rule</em></strong> &#8211; Malcolm Gladwell</li><li>It&#8217;s a lifetime accumulation of deliberate practice that ends up explaining excellence.</li></ul><ul><li>Just the spending the time isn&#8217;t enough &#8211; if you show up and work hard &#8211; you&#8217;ll hit a performance plateau beyond which you can&#8217;t get any better &#8211; You need a combination of discipline, dedication &amp; deliberate practice.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Craving for Critical Feedback &#8211; </strong>more direct, harsh feedback and faster feedback loops is important.</li><li><strong>Taking up stuff that is beyond your comfort zone &#8211; </strong>Intentional allocation of time.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Five Habits of a Craftsman</strong><ol type="1"><li><em>Decide What Capital Market You’re In</em><ul><li>Winner takes all &#8211; There&#8217;s only one type of capital available and lots of people are competing for it. For e.g television writing.</li><li>Auction&nbsp; &#8211; unstructured, where each individual can bring in their unique collection &#8211; for e.g Technology</li></ul></li><li><em>Identify your Capital Type</em><ul><li>In Winner takes all Market, there&#8217;s only one capital type, so you got to have it.</li><li>In Auction market &#8211;&nbsp; it&#8217;s useful to seek <strong><em>Open Gates</em></strong> &#8211; as in exploring opportunities to build capital that are already open to you. This will get your further faster than starting from scratch.</li></ul></li><li><em>Define Good &#8211; Geoff Colvin &#8211; </em><a href="https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/30/8391794/index.htm"><em>What it takes to be great</em></a><ol type="1"><li>Come up with goals that would determine if you have acquired career capital</li></ol></li><li><em>Stretch &amp; Destroy</em><ul><li>Doing things we know how to do well is enjoyable, and that’s exactly the opposite of what deliberate practice demands.… <strong>Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration</strong>. That is what makes it “deliberate,” as distinct from the mindless playing of scales or hitting of tennis balls that most people engage in…</li></ul></li><li><em>Be Patient</em><ol type="1"><li>Diligence &#8211; It&#8217;s less about paying attention to main pursuit and more about your willingness to ignore other shiny things that will come along the way to distract.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ul>



<h3><em>Rule #3 &#8211; Importance of Control</em></h3>



<ul><li><em>Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfilment.</em><ul><li>Autonomy &amp; Control &#8211; Daniel Pink</li><li>ROWE (Results only work environment) was highly successful at many places (BBY, Gap etc)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Control Traps</strong><ul><li>It&#8217;s dangerous to pursue more control before you&#8217;ve acquired enough career capital to offer in exchange</li><li>The point at which you&#8217;ve acquired enough career capital to get meaningful control over your working life is exactly the point you become very important your employer and they&#8217;ll prevent you from making the change.</li><li>The Key is to know when the time is right to become courageous in your career decisions</li></ul></li><li><strong>Avoiding Control Traps</strong><ul><li>Law of Financial Viability<ul><li>When deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, seek evidence of whether people are willing to pay for it. If you find this evidence, continue. If not, move on</li><li>Definition of “<strong><em>willing to pay</em></strong>” varies. In some cases, it literally means customers paying you money for a product or a service. But it can also mean getting approved for a loan, receiving an outside investment, or, more commonly, convincing an employer to either hire you or keep writing you paychecks. Once you adopt this flexible definition of “pay for it,” this law starts popping up all over</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3><em>Rule #4 &#8211; Importance of Mission</em> (Think big act Small)</h3>



<ul><li>Multiples in science discoveries (for e.g Batteries, Oxygen Isolation, randomized linear encoding)</li><li><strong>Adjacent Possible</strong> (reference &#8211; Steven Johnson &#8211; where good ideas come from)<ul><li>The next big ideas in any field are found right beyond the current cutting edge, in the adjacent space that contains the possible new combination of existing ideas</li></ul></li><li>Understanding the adjacent possible and its role in innovation is the first link in a chain of argument that explains how to identify a good career mission</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Little Bets</strong><ul><li>in the setting of mission exploration, has the following characteristics:</li><li>&nbsp;It’s a project small enough to be completed in less than a month.</li><li>It forces you to create new value (e.g., master a new skill and produce new results that didn’t exist before).</li><li>It produces a concrete result that you can use to gather concrete feedback.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Law of Remarkability</strong><ul><li>For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking</li></ul></li></ul>
