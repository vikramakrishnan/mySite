<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2 Kinds of Leaders</h2>



<ul><li><strong><em>Reward centered</em></strong><ol><li>They see the moving to leadership as a reward of what they’ve achieved so far and is a prize.</li><li>Focus on the &#8220;glory&#8221;, &#8220;prestige&#8221;, &#8220;rewards&#8221; for achieving pinnacle of success</li><li>They usually pick and choose what they want to do as leader and do what is usually something they feel they are good at or have fun.</li></ol></li><li><strong><em>Responsibility centered</em></strong><ol type="i"><li>Look at this as a responsibility rather than reward.</li><li>Don’t shy away from doing what is required for someone at this job</li><li>The experience of being &#8216;<em>responsibility centered</em>&#8216; leader should be tough and challenging</li><li>Look at this from the perspective of the people they lead, rather than themselves.</li></ol></li></ul>



<ul><li>There&#8217;s no pure &#8220;Reward&#8221; / &#8220;Responsibility&#8221; focused Leader. People are usually in a spectrum. You need to ensure you are more aligned toward Responsibility centered.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Responsibility centered Leaders need to be aware of the <strong>Trap</strong> &#8211; when they are being responsibility centered leader, people tend to praise them and agree with them quite a lot and this can lead people to move down the path of Reward centered leadership.<ul><li>Have a strong inner circle who can challenge and keep them honest</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5 Core responsibilities</strong> </h2>



<p>These are responsibilities that &#8220;<em>Reward centered</em>&#8221; Leaders usually ignore or don&#8217;t do well</p>



<ul><li><strong><em>Having difficult &amp; uncomfortable conversations</em></strong><ul><li>Addressing Bad behavior immediately and not tolerating regardless of how good the direct report is at their job</li><li>Don&#8217;t avoid these hard conversations</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Managing subordinates</em></strong><ul><li>Individual coaching and guidance is necessary at all levels. This has got nothing to do with the person&#8217;s experience.</li><li><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color"><em>If you feel you should be able to trust people to manage themselves, or justify not knowing what your direct reports are doing by justifying not being a micromanager, then your motive for leading is wrong.</em></span></li><li><strong><em>Micromanagement</em></strong> &#8212; <span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">the only people who call management, micromanagement are the ones trying to avoid accountability</span>.</li><li><strong>As a leader, you need to</strong><ul><li>Know what they are working on</li><li>Know their progress</li><li>Give them the right feedback and coaching</li></ul></li><li>Lots of experience doesn&#8217;t mean people don&#8217;t have to be managed. It&#8217;s not sign of punishment or lack of trust. It&#8217;s giving them the benefit of direction and coaching.</li><li>Best of sportsmen pay people to coach them.</li><li>Stopping managing is a sign of neglect.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Running great team meetings</em></strong><ul><li>Running boring meetings / avoiding them</li><li>Outcome based meetings</li><li>If you allow in-effective meetings to happens, this will percolate to entire org</li><li><strong><em>Bad Meetings == Bad decisions</em></strong></li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Developing Leadership team</em></strong><ul><li>If you feel this is something touchy-feely and waste of time, then your motive for being a leader isn&#8217;t right.</li><li>Hiring != delegating to HR</li><li>It&#8217;s not just a annual meeting or gala for team building</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong><em>Communicating constantly &amp; repeatedly</em></strong><ul><li>Research says it takes <strong>7 times</strong> for people to hear the same message before believe execs are serious about it.</li><li><strong>CEOs need to be Chief Reminding Officers</strong></li><li>You always need to over communicate.</li></ul></li></ul>

He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how can I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, “What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?” “Oh,” he said, “for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!” Whereupon I replied, “You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering — to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her.” He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.&#8221;</em></li></ul></li><li><em>&#8220;Suffering is not necessary to find meaning in life, meaning is possible inspite of suffering&#8221;</em></li><li>Question : &#8220;Do monkeys / guinea pigs who get pricked multiple times know they are serving a great cause for the humans?&#8221; &#8211; they most certainly don&#8217;t but they still server a purpose.

On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person?

This was suggested for use in the case of anxiety or phobias, in which humor and ridicule can be used when fear is paralyzing.

To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.&#8221;</em></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Socratic Dialogue</em></strong><ul><li>Help someone realize the answer to their question / self discovery through the use of their own words</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>No-o Dynamics</strong><ul><li>Man&#8217;s search for meaning may arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed listening to Gaur Gopal Das speak and this time, <em><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">How to find Balance and Purpose in Life</span></em>, an attractive minor heading got me hooked to this book.</p>



<p>Gaur Gopal Das draws an analogy to wheels of a car and states that the secret of Life is finding the balance and just like a car balances on 4 wheels, we must balance 4 critical aspects/areas of Life.</p>



<ol class="has-medium-font-size"><li><em><strong>Personal Life</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Relationships</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Work Life</strong></em></li><li><em><strong>Social contribution</strong></em></li></ol>



<p>Furthermore, <strong><em>Balance</em></strong> is split into 2 kinds :</p>



<p><strong><em>External Balancing (alignment)</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>Adjust priorities based on the situation at the moment and focusing on that particular wheel that needs attention.</li><li>Tenets are <strong><em>Balance</em></strong> and <strong><em>Adjustment</em></strong></li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Internal Balancing</em></strong></p>



<ul><li>This is about our attitude and values, more like air in the tyres &#8211; If the air pressure is not right, there&#8217;ll be puncture.</li><li>Tenets are <strong><em>Attitude</em></strong> and <strong><em>values</em></strong>.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Sprituality</em></strong> is another important aspect mentioned in this book and going back to Car analogy, this is compared as being the steering wheel. Even if you have all wheels of the car balanced and aligned with the right air pressure, not having the steering wheel means you&#8217;ll never reach the destination.</p>



<ul><li>In whatever genuine form, spirituality brings purpose to our life and gives a destination worth going</li><li>Comprised of 4 pieces (4 S&#8217;s) &#8211; <strong><em>Spiritual Practice</em></strong> (<em>Sadhana</em>), <strong><em>Company we keep</em></strong> (<em>Sangha</em>), <strong><em>Our Character</em></strong> (<em>Sadachar</em>), <strong>Our service to god &amp; </strong><strong><em>others</em></strong> (<em>Seva</em>)</li><li>When all these 4 are aligned properly we&#8217;ll be able to drive the car of our life to its destination</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wheel #1 &#8211; Personal Life</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Expressing Gratitude</em></strong></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em>See the Positive</em></strong><ul><li>We all boil at different degrees!</li><li>I am not saying these problems don’t exist, but the real problem is that when negativity consumes the mind, not only do we lose the vision to see the beautiful things around us, but also the ability to solve the problems that confront us.</li><li><strong><em>We have to train our mind to focus on the positive and feel empowered to deal with the negative.</em></strong></li><li>When we think negatively of people, we should immediately counteract that energy by contemplating three positive qualities they have</li><li>Episode of the <strong><em>cumin seed stuck in teeth</em></strong> &#8211; Mind is the like the tongue, it drifts towards negative areas of Life, making us restless and uneasy. It schemes to uproot the problems that&#8217;s causing pain, not realising that persistent scheming causes more emotional damage.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Gratitude is not a feeling</em></strong>; it is a state of mind that can be developed, and it allows us to tap into a reservoir of unlimited positive energy.</li><li><strong><em>Being grateful happens in two steps.</em></strong><ol><li>The first is to realize that there is good in the world and that good has fallen upon us.</li><li>The second is to know that goodness is coming from something other than us, an external reality is giving the gifts of grace to our very own reality. This could be our family, our friends, nature and even God. We have so much to be grateful for!</li></ol></li><li>Even in times of difficulty and sorrow, we can feel the inner strength, when we are grateful for the support of caring friends and family.</li><li><strong><em>How to express gratitude</em></strong><ul><li><strong><em>Recognize</em></strong> the good that has been done to us and say Thank you</li><li><strong><em>Remember </em></strong>what good was done and mean the Thank You!<ul><li>Contemplation is the best methods to develop gratitude.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Reciprocate</em></strong> Live the Thank You- through your actions and give back.</li><li><strong>Gratitude Log</strong><ul><li>Reflect on the last 24 hours and identify 3-5 people or situation that you are grateful for</li><li>Be very descriptive so it becomes easy to excavate the emotion from you.</li><li>Once every week, it should also contain 3-5 action points to thank people you are grateful for.</li><li>When doing this feel the happiness you felt when the good was done to you.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Press Pause</em></strong></h3>



<ul><li>Joshua Bell &#8211; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnOPu0_YWhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social experiment with Washington Post</a>&nbsp; &amp; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/pearls-before-breakfast-can-one-of-the-nations-great-musicians-cut-through-the-fog-of-a-dc-rush-hour-lets-find-out/2014/09/23/8a6d46da-4331-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article</a></li><li>If we don&#8217;t pause, we miss a lot of beautiful moments in life.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><em>Why Worry</em></strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://randommusings506939532.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/image-3.png?w=480" alt="Then...why worry?? | Why worry, Cool words, Inspirational quotes" class="wp-image-204" width="358" height="503"/></figure></div>


<ul><li>Learning to detach ourselves from situations outside of our control is an imperative skill to learn for personal growth.</li><li>This doesn&#8217;t mean you should be lazy &#8211; we should do everything in our power to rectify the situation, but after that we should take our attention away from the unpleasant circumstance.</li><li>What we see as bad at one point in time may turn out to be good for us and, what we see as good at another point may turn out to be bad for us. We should not judge the situation by its face value.</li><li>Sometimes when we get engrossed in a problem, we feel trapped in our own minds. In that state, we constantly regurgitate our issues, causing us a lot of emotional pain. A spiritual process gives us the ability to come out of this mental loop and helps transform the greatest difficulties into opportunities.’</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Importance of Meditation</em></h3>



<ul><li>Takes time and needs discipline. All the more important for people who feel they don&#8217;t have the time.</li><li>Like a plane, takes us high, far away and further away imperceptibly. If you look out of a window, you don&#8217;t seem like moving fast, but later you realize how far you&#8217;ve come.</li><li>Allows experience of self realization.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wheel #2 : Relationships</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Be sensitive with our words and actions</em></h3>



<ul><li><strong><em><span class="has-inline-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-color">Fight the strong urge to judge someone based on an initial interaction with them</span></em></strong>. Everyone has a fascinating story that we know nothing about.</li><li>Being attentive in our relationships is crucial to our success. How we behave towards others determines the quality of our life. ‘<strong><em>It’s just my personality</em></strong>’ is not an acceptable excuse to be insensitive towards others.</li><li><strong><em>Golden Rule</em></strong> : Treat someone better than how you&#8217;d want to be treated. Ask the question &#8211; &#8220;Does my tone of voice, body language, behavior reflect sensitivity&#8221;</li><li>&#8220;<em><strong>Familiarity breeds contempt </strong>&#8211; </em>When we are overly familiar with people, we forget how important they are to us and the correct way to behave with them&#8221;</li><li><strong><em>Attitude doesn&#8217;t discriminate</em></strong> &#8211; Treating inanimate objects with insensitivity will gradually leads us to treating everyone the same way.</li></ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Look at the Positives</em></h3>



<ul><li>Always see the best in people &#8211; Like a bee that always looks for flowers with nectar and avoid lingering where there&#8217;s dirt.</li><li>5 different ways to perceive people in our relationships.<ol type="1"><li><em><b>Person who cannot see the Good at all&nbsp; (e.g </b></em><strong><em>neighbours dirty clothes &amp; window)</em></strong><ul><li>This kind only sees the bad and magnifies it out of proportion</li><li>Possible reasons maybe &#8211; spite, dislike, insecurity</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Person who sees both Good and Bad, but chooses to neglect the Good (e.g dog that shopped and forgot the keys)</em></strong><ul><li>Happens so often &#8211; Our friends and family, do so much but we neglect and focus only on the bad things.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Person who sees both Good and Bad and is neutral to both</em></strong><ul><li>Difficult to find this type &#8211; they are indifferent to everything and don&#8217;t care much for anything.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Person who sees both Good and Bad and consciously chooses to neglect the Bad</em></strong><ul><li>Really tough to live this as it requires you to consciously avoid the natural human tendency to focus on the bad.</li><li>E.g Aditya Birla &#8211; Speaking tree employee who caused a huge loss, started by making a list &#8211;&nbsp; <strong><em>&#8220;Points in favour of this employee&#8221;</em></strong> to create the conscious attention to shift focus to positive.

That is how a an open-minded person thinks.</em></strong></span></li><li>Healthy Competition is about competing with ourselves rather than others</li><li>There&#8217;ll always be workplace politics and we should learn to manage it in a clean way.</li></ul>

When one’s character is transformed by following even a sentence of the rich philosophy, then those actions are called aachaar.</li><li><strong>Prachaar</strong>: The good conduct of a spiritual practitioner inspires others to have faith in the philosophy and values of spirituality. Without having to give a single sermon, we can reach out to many just by being exemplary and having good character. <strong><em>What great men do, common men follow</em></strong>.</li></ul></li></ul>

In some cases, it literally means customers paying you money for a product or a service.

<ul><li><strong>Little Bets</strong><ul><li>in the setting of mission exploration, has the following characteristics:</li><li>&nbsp;It’s a project small enough to be completed in less than a month.</li><li>It forces you to create new value (e.g., master a new skill and produce new results that didn’t exist before).</li><li>It produces a concrete result that you can use to gather concrete feedback.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Law of Remarkability</strong><ul><li>For a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be remarkable in two different ways. First, it must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others. Second, it must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>According to Lencioni, an Ideal Team player is someone who </p>



<ul><li><em>Is Humble, Hungry and Smart (people)</em></li><li>Is someone who can easily build Trust</li><li>Has healthy conflict<ul><li><em>&#8220;Argues about the right way to get things done without worrying that they&#8217;re going to offend someone&#8221;</em></li></ul></li><li>is Capable of being honest &amp; vulnerable<ul><li><em>&#8220;Getting people to admit when they make a mistake on a project&#8221;</em></li></ul></li><li>Holds each other in the team accountable</li><li>is Results oriented (team&#8217;s results) , history of getting difficult things done.<ul><li><em>&#8220;Sticking to commitments&#8221;</em></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>In all practical situations, you&#8217;ll find people exhibiting just one or two of these traits, but can be coached to being an ideal team player. Here&#8217;s a classification that Lencioni describes of people who don&#8217;t exhibit all 3 traits.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve now become a fan of Lencioni&#8217;s books and love the way he lays out the plot and introduces the concept with clear guidance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this book, Lencioni talks about the 5 dysfunctions of a team &#8211; how to identify them, and what can be done to fix them. It also calls out the role of a leader in fixing these dysfunctions.&nbsp;</p>

<ol><li>Trust is the foundation of great teams</li><li>If there&#8217;s no trust, there&#8217;s not going to be any open constructive idealogical debate. There&#8217;ll just be a sense of artificial harmony</li><li>Because there weren&#8217;t any debate, there&#8217;s a lot of ambiguity and the team won’t buy into the decisions &#8211; resulting with no commitment.</li><li>Because there&#8217;s no clarity/commitment, we wouldn&#8217;t hold each other accountable and call out when things aren&#8217;t progressing towards our goal.</li><li>Since there&#8217;s no accountable, members only focus on their own results and not the team&#8217;s.</li></ol>
