<ul><li>&#8220;<em>The extraordinary Genius of Albert Einstein</em> ” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8Zkd9VYdp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youtube</a>)- reflecting on the principle of relativity in terms of social relations and individual identities or thought processes, asking the question &#8211; how was Einstein able to make his breakthrough?</li><li>&#8221; <em>Can we all become Geniuses</em> ” (<a href="https://www.discoveryplus.in/videos/morgan-freemans-through-the-wormhole/can-we-all-become-geniuses?seasonId=7&amp;type=EPISODE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discovery+)</a> &#8211; From the episode of &#8220;Through the Wormhole&#8221; narrated by Morgan Freeman &#8211; Genius lies somewhere in the human mind, bringing mathematical insight, sparking artistic inspiration and enabling some to see what most cannot.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of PageRank is Over!</a>&nbsp;– With search patterns increasingly moving over from traditional search engines to products like TikTok, Instagram etc, it’s only natural that we’ll very soon have AI powered, hyper-personalized search systems that’ll determine what I see, read, use and recommend.</li>



<li><a href="https://architecturenotes.co/redis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architecture Notes &#8211; Redis</a> – Architecture Notes is quickly becoming my go to place to reinforce fundamentals. I like the way the content is organized and presented in an effective way to makes learning fun.</li>



<li><a href="https://roadmap.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Career Roadmaps for Developers</a>&nbsp;– By far one of the best organized contents I’ve seen to help developers in picking up a path and guide their learning. Best part – it’s open source, so if you want to add something you don’t see and think it’ll be useful for the community, submit a PR.</li>



<li><a href="https://dev.to/jeroendedauw/advice-for-junior-developers-30am" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advice for Junior Developers</a>&nbsp;– I wish I read this before talking to a bunch of junior devs a couple days ago. This article presents an important list of things that budding devs should start assimilating as part of their work. While many of us would feel this is intuitive, actioning it needs intentional practice.</li>



<li><a href="https://makeavideo.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Make-A-Video</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://phenaki.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phenaki</a>&nbsp;– Following Meta AI’s announcement 2 weeks ago of their “text to Video” generator, Google has release 2 of their own text to video generators this week. It’s amazing to see the acceleration in text to image, video and audio models. Looking forward to a full-fledged movie created by AI only with story prompts!</li>



<li><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/resiliency-in-distributed-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resiliency in Distributed Systems</a> &#8211; A good read on some fundamentals to consider when working on large scale systems specifically around downstream and upstream resiliency.</li>



<li><a href="https://typefully.com/DanHollick/qr-codes-T7tLlNi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QR Codes!</a>&nbsp;In fascinating that the Toyota subsidiary that invented the QR code never exercised its patent and released it for free making these pixelated blobs&nbsp;omnipresent and so useful these days.</li>



<li><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/09/12/open-source/memlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MemLab: An open source framework for finding JavaScript memory leaks</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Interesting read on how Facebook detects in-browser memory leaks and how it’s benefitted them.</li>



<li>Taking it light and doing a small tech history lesson, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Where GREP Came From &#8211; Computerphile</a> – Computerphile was recommended to me by <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hariprasadkulkarni/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hari</a></strong> and I found some of their content very informative with some interesting speakers on the lineup.</li>



<li><a href="https://siliconangle.com/2022/08/31/meta-ai-researchers-develop-ways-read-speech-peoples-brains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta &#8211; AI, Read speech from Brain</a> – I’ve always been fascinated with the human brain and wondered if we’d ever fully understand and decode its inner workings. Here’s an interested read where Meta’s FAIR lab has been able to decode speech from non-invasive recordings of brain activity! Mind reading slowly becoming real.</li>



<li><strong>__</strong><a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZStandard</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Thanks&nbsp; <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/subramaniajeeva/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeeva</a></strong> &nbsp;for sharing this one. ZStandard is a fast compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression. The reference library offers a very wide range of speed / compression trade-off, and is backed by an extremely fast decoder</li>



<li><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/why-firefox-deserves-its-sad-decline-1c44d9ba59c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox and its sad decline…</a> – I love Firefox, but this is an example what happens to a product when there&#8217;s mis-timing, lack of customer focus and market understanding issues coupled with bad decisions. It&#8217;s sad to see Firefox fall from over 34% browser market share in 2010 to less than 3.5% currently.</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engineering Ladders</a> – This is a wonderful resource for Managers that’ll help in having meaningful career conversations around expectations at each level for both Engineering and management tracks.

This post explores some of this nuance and has a good further reading on other thoughts on the same topic as well</li>



<li><strong>__</strong><a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jul/9/gpt-3-explain-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Can GPT-3 explain how code works?</a> – I was amazed by the extent to which models like GPT-3 &amp; OpenAI Codex are getting increasingly efficient at writing code. Makes me wonder when we’d land in a situation where we no longer hire programmers</li>



<li>**<a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/whats-in-a-good-error-message/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What&#8217;s in a good Error Message</a>? **– <em>Extremely important for all engineering devs and leads reviewing code. Both the article and the discussion/comments following it has several extremely using nuggets we should think about.</em></li>

With tech like GPT-3, Imagen etc, answering questions like this, fact checking news articles, authenticating artwork will get increasingly difficult with expanding AI prowess.</li>

<div style="height:26px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a list of Podcast episodes i&#8217;ve found worth sharing.</h6>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-layne-norton-the-science-of-eating-for-health-fat-loss-and-lean-muscle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Layne Norton: The Science of Eating…</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;From the Huberman Lab podcast, this is by far the most comprehensive information I’ve seen on diet, nutrition, Health &amp; the entire science behind it. Dr. Layne and Dr. Huberman cover a wide variety of important topics in this really long form episode, but you can find timestamps to sections that you can use to know about things you feel important.</li>



<li><a href="https://hbr.org/video/6312276697112/how-to-work-with-a-passiveaggressive-coworker-the-harvard-business-review-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Work with a Passive-Aggressive Coworker</a> – From the HBR channel, this is an 8 min video episode with some great tips to deal with passive aggressive folks at work. We’ve all been there on both sides of the table and understanding this a bit more can help us all become a bit better.</li>



<li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/thriving-in-the-face-of-contradiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thriving In The Face Of Contradiction</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Another good one from Hidden Brain. From the podcast excerpt &#8211; “ <em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we’re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either/or choices. But psychologist <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/wendy-smith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wendy Smith</a>&nbsp;says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap. She offers a different way to think about difficult choices, one that opens unexpected possibilities.”</em></li>



<li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/whats-wrong-with-holding-a-grudge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Stupid Questions &#8211; What&#8217;s wrong with holding a grudge?</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Another good conversation between Angela and Stephen where they talk about the emotional cost of grudge, how to let go of resentment, whether Apologies work.</li>



<li><a href="https://allinchamathjason.libsyn.com/e96-adobe-acquires-figma-for-20b-tpb-spac-fedex-ceos-recession-warning-macro-picture-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All-In &#8211; Adobe acquires Figma for $20B, TPB SPAC, FedEx CEO&#8217;s recession warning, macro picture &amp; more</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;It takes some getting used to this podcast format of multi-participant discussion on varied topics, but once you are over it, you’ll come to appreciate the depth of analysis on topics and the amount of critical thinking involved and the kind of questions raised. In this episode Chamath, sacks and others dissect the Adobe-Figma deal &amp; fears of a global recession.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/worklife_with_adam_grant_authenticity_is_a_double_edged_sword" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Authenticity is a double-edged sword</a> – Another gem from Adam Grant where he talks about what effective authenticity looks like and how we can learn to strike the right balance.</li>



<li><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleep Toolkit: Tools For Optimizing Sleep &amp; Sleep-Wake Timing</a>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;Dr. Huberman provides practical tips to improve and optimize sleep patterns. I&#8217;ve personally incorporated some of this (morning sunlight exposure, core body temperature rise, early dinner)&nbsp; in my daily routine and can definitely see improvements in waking up energy, sleep quality etc.</li>



<li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-2-0-befriending-your-inner-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You 2.0 &#8211; Befriending your inner voice</a> – What we say to ourselves, and our inner voice is a big contributor to how we think, act, react and transform. This podcast covers the effect of this chatter, and how to keep our negative emotions from transforming to chatter and harness its power in a constructive way.</li>



<li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/should-you-try-to-be-less-angry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Should You Try to Be Less Angry?</a> – Another one from my favorite podcasts – “No Stupid Questions” where Angela and Stephen discuss about Anger and it effects. While it’s not always good to keep the pot boiling, Anger as evolutionary measure does come in handy in situations and it is important we learn more about how to tackle our emotions and understand its effects.</li>



<li><a href="https://tim.blog/2022/06/28/edward-o-thorp-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Master Investor Ed Thorp on How to think for yourself and many more topics</a> – This is a long format podcast but there&#8217;s some invaluable takeaways from Ed&#8217;s experience. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</li>



<li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/why-youre-smarter-than-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why you&#8217;re smarter than you think!</a> – From the Hidden brain show notes – “ <em>From the time we are schoolchildren, we are ranked and sorted based on how smart we are. But what if our assumptions about intelligence limit our potential? This week, psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman proposes a more expansive notion of what it means to be “smart</em> &#8220;.</li>



<li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-simple-is-too-simple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>How simple is too simple</strong></a> – <em>In this episode of “No Stupid Questions”, Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner discuss the obsession humans have with magic bullet solutions and why there are no simple answers.</em></li>



<li><a href="https://link.chtbl.com/KmhQvIwN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Change Your Workplace</a> – Adam Grant’s “Work Life” has been one of my all-time favorite podcasts and in this episode he delves into “Change” and how each one of us no matter where we are in the hierarchy can bring about meaningful, positive, long-lasting change and motivate people to embrace new ideas.</li>



<li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/why-conversations-go-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mind Reading 2.0: Why Conversations go wrong</a> hosted by Shankar Vedantam (<a href="https://twitter.com/HiddenBrain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@HiddenBrain</a>) where they talk about conversational styles and why understanding them is important to be able to effectively communicate.</li>

<h6 class="wp-block-heading">Here&#8217;s a list of Videos i&#8217;ve watched in the past and found worth sharing.</h6>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2Y0GMCFWq0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Could one vaccine protect against everything?</a>&nbsp;– This is the same question I had when taking 3 shots of the COVID vaccine. I wonder how a world without diseases would look like and what would happen to the entire healthcare sector (apart from these vaccine makers) when this becomes true.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXwStduNw14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematics is the sense you never knew you had!</a> – I wish I had a Maths teacher like Eddie woo. In this inspiring TED talk he makes a case for why Mathematics is a sense just like touch &amp; sound and in the process inspires us to think differently about it.
