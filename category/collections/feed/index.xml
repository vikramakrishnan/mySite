<li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/thriving-in-the-face-of-contradiction/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Thriving In The Face Of Contradiction</a> – Another good one from Hidden Brain. From the podcast excerpt &#8211; “ <em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we’re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either/or choices. But psychologist <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/wendy-smith/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wendy Smith</a> says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap. She offers a different way to think about difficult choices, one that opens unexpected possibilities.”</em></li>



<li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/whats-wrong-with-holding-a-grudge/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">No Stupid Questions &#8211; What&#8217;s wrong with holding a grudge?</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;Another good conversation between Angela and Stephen where they talk about the emotional cost of grudge, how to let go of resentment, whether Apologies work.</li>



<li><a href="https://allinchamathjason.libsyn.com/e96-adobe-acquires-figma-for-20b-tpb-spac-fedex-ceos-recession-warning-macro-picture-more" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">All-In &#8211; Adobe acquires Figma for $20B, TPB SPAC, FedEx CEO&#8217;s recession warning, macro picture &amp; more</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;It takes some getting used to this podcast format of multi-participant discussion on varied topics, but once you are over it, you’ll come to appreciate the depth of analysis on topics and the amount of critical thinking involved and the kind of questions raised. In this episode Chamath, sacks and others dissect the Adobe-Figma deal &amp; fears of a global recession.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/worklife_with_adam_grant_authenticity_is_a_double_edged_sword" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Authenticity is a double-edged sword</a> – Another gem from Adam Grant where he talks about what effective authenticity looks like and how we can learn to strike the right balance.</li>



<li><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Sleep Toolkit: Tools For Optimizing Sleep &amp; Sleep-Wake Timing</a>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;Dr. Huberman provides practical tips to improve and optimize sleep patterns. I&#8217;ve personally incorporated some of this (morning sunlight exposure, core body temperature rise, early dinner)&nbsp; in my daily routine and can definitely see improvements in waking up energy, sleep quality etc.</li>



<li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-2-0-befriending-your-inner-voice/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">You 2.0 &#8211; Befriending your inner voice</a> – What we say to ourselves, and our inner voice is a big contributor to how we think, act, react and transform.

<li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/should-you-try-to-be-less-angry/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Should You Try to Be Less Angry?</a> – Another one from my favorite podcasts – “No Stupid Questions” where Angela and Stephen discuss about Anger and it effects. While it’s not always good to keep the pot boiling, Anger as evolutionary measure does come in handy in situations and it is important we learn more about how to tackle our emotions and understand its effects.</li>



<li><a href="https://tim.blog/2022/06/28/edward-o-thorp-2/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Master Investor Ed Thorp on How to think for yourself and many more topics</a> – This is a long format podcast but there&#8217;s some invaluable takeaways from Ed&#8217;s experience. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</li>



<li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/why-youre-smarter-than-you-think/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Why you&#8217;re smarter than you think!</a> – From the Hidden brain show notes – “ <em>From the time we are schoolchildren, we are ranked and sorted based on how smart we are.

<h6>Here&#8217;s a list of Videos i&#8217;ve watched in the past and found worth sharing.</h6>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXwStduNw14" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Mathematics is the sense you never knew you had!</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;I wish I had a Maths teacher like Eddie woo. In this inspiring TED talk he makes a case for why Mathematics is a sense just like touch &amp; sound and in the process inspires us to think differently about it. I wish schools taught these early on.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWTNMzK9vG4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Why you procrastinate even when it feels bad</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;I’m a master procrastinator and have been trying hard to overcome it for many years now (maybe procrastinating too much the actions required to overcome procrastination!) While I’ve gotten progressively better it’s important to understand the underlying reasons for why we put off things so we can learn to become better. This video talks about the importance of balancing emotions and how they can affect why we put off certain things and what we can do to change.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History</a> – How did one man’s effort or a specific business’s interest create a long standing health problem and environmental catastrophe of the modern world is the premise of this video. I personally learnt a lot of new and interesting things in the video. Some parts chemistry, some parts psychology and a bit of economics!</li>
