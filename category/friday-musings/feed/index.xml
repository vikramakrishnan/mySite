<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>

There&#8217;s never a time when I have come out of a video from this channel without learning something new and also wondering how some of the simplest things we assume from our schooling can actually be very complex.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Books I’m (re) Reading</em></strong></h3>



<p>Reread my notes from the book  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Nudge</a> after listening to the recent episode of Hidden Brain on &#8220;<a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-2-0-how-to-see-yourself-clearly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How to see yourself clearly</a>&#8220;. The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">choice architecture</a> and its influence on people as described in Nudge made me think about comment from the podcast – “<em>We often make important decisions in our life and love for reasons we don&#8217;t even realize</em>”</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/why-firefox-deserves-its-sad-decline-1c44d9ba59c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Firefox and its sad decline&#8230;</a> – I love Firefox, but this is an example what happens to a product when there&#8217;s mis-timing, lack of customer focus and market understanding issues coupled with bad decisions. It&#8217;s sad to see Firefox fall from over 34% browser market share in 2010 to less than 3.5% currently.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/16/1028580/pandemic-mental-health-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How to mend your broken pandemic brain</a> – COVID-19 pandemic has truly hit the humankind in all possible areas including messing up our brains. As the world slowly starts its recovery journey, this article talks about some of the impacts to our brain and how we can help fix it faster.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Movies I watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9263550/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Rocketry &#8211; The Nambi Effect</a> – (IMDb &#8211; 9.1) &#8211; After many months, this was a movie that shook me. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ActorMadhavan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">R.Madhavan</a> for making this and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambi_Narayanan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Dr. Nambi</a> an unsung hero who&#8217;s love for this country and passion for science has no parallels. What intrigued me when I watched this movie, is the impact media (news/television/social media etc.) has in creating a viral perception (right /wrong) about a person and how we as consumers embrace that without question and judge people. In an era of AI taking over content creation and propagation, it&#8217;s very important that each one of us have some moral and factual compass before coming to a judgement on piece of info we see out there.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-2-0-befriending-your-inner-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">You 2.0 &#8211; Befriending your inner voice</a> – What we say to ourselves, and our inner voice is a big contributor to how we think, act, react and transform. This podcast covers the effect of this chatter, and how to keep our negative emotions from transforming to chatter and harness its power in a constructive way.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings&nbsp; </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Engineering Ladders</a> – This is a wonderful resource for Managers that’ll help in having meaningful career conversations around expectations at each level for both Engineering and management tracks. This is not intended to be used as a checklist for promotions, rather a guidance for career conversations</p>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32226910" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ask HN: I&#8217;m in a rut. How did you get out of yours?</a> – This active thread on HackerNews has lot of tips and discussions on how to handle and recover from Burnout and languishing. What intrigued me was, how a simple question when asked in a powerful forum could lead to tons of learning. Never be afraid to ask questions!</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I’m watching</em></strong></h3>



<p>As someone who personally struggles with initiating the first conversation, I found &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4Zu5ZZAG7I" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">7 Ways to Make a Conversation with Anyone</a> very insightful and practical. It’s a beautiful TEDx talk that you’ll appreciate if you are working to get better at connecting and talking to someone.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/should-you-try-to-be-less-angry/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Should You Try to Be Less Angry?</a> – Another one from my favorite podcasts – “No Stupid Questions” where Angela and Stephen discuss about Anger and it effects. While it’s not always good to keep the pot boiling, Anger as evolutionary measure does come in handy in situations and it is important we learn more about how to tackle our emotions and understand its effects.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://refactoring.fm/p/the-power-of-inversion-" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Power of Inversion</a> – &#8220;<em>Avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance</em>&#8220;. This post explores some common applications of the Inversion mental model in engineering and how we can use it to make things better.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-i-become-director-guru-bhat/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How can I become a Director? </a>&nbsp;– A very well written piece by Guru Bhat on what it takes to become a director. Eloquent as always, Guru hits the bulls eye on some key attributes that everyone should aspire to attain if they are on a quest for this title. I’ve been fortunate to learn by experience how “Bias for Action” can be a key differentiator in creating value for our stakeholders.</p>



<h3><strong><em>What worries me!</em></strong></h3>



<p>It’s hard to miss the series of natural calamities rocking the already pandemic struck world right now. From the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/19/google_oracle_cloud/?mc_cid=1674b3c928&amp;mc_eid=2b8cf1fb98" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">extreme heat waves in UK &amp; Europe</a> to <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2022/07/21/indias-monsoon-havoc-a-result-of-climate-change-experts-say/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Cloud bursts and Flash floods in India</a>, It’s time each one of us do our part to slow down climate change. <a href="https://medium.com/@cinthia.espino/why-is-0-5-c-so-important-3961b9989387" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Read this</a> if you want to know what a 0.5° Celsius change could mean to earth and <a href="https://coastal.climatecentral.org/map/10/72.9068/18.9721/?theme=sea_level_rise&amp;map_type=year&amp;basemap=roadmap&amp;contiguous=true&amp;elevation_model=best_available&amp;forecast_year=2040&amp;pathway=ssp3rcp70&amp;percentile=p50&amp;refresh=true&amp;return_level=return_level_0&amp;rl_model=gtsr&amp;slr_model=ipcc_2021_med" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">see these projections</a> of cities that would be under water if the sea-levels continues to rise.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://tim.blog/2022/06/28/edward-o-thorp-2/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Master Investor Ed Thorp on How to think for yourself and many more topics</a> – This is a long format podcast but there&#8217;s some invaluable takeaways from Ed&#8217;s experience. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/24/ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ML Codegen Vs Coding by Hand</a> – In the previous musings I shared about auto code-gen and it got me intrigued into aspects that are debatable and why we should tread with care. This post explores some of this nuance and has a good further reading on other thoughts on the same topic as well</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you really think that the environment is less important than the economy, try holding your breath while you count your money</p><cite>Guy McPherson</cite></blockquote>
