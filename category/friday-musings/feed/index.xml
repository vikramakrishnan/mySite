<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-i-become-director-guru-bhat/">How can I become a Director? </a> – A very well written piece by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurubhat/">Guru Bhat</a> on what it takes to become a director. Eloquent as always, Guru hits the bulls eye on some key attributes that everyone should aspire to attain if they are on a quest for this title. I’ve been fortunate to learn by experience how “Bias for Action” can be a key differentiator in creating value for our stakeholders.</p>



<h3><strong><em>What worries me!</em></strong></h3>



<p>It’s hard to miss the series of natural calamities rocking the already pandemic struck world right now.

<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://tim.blog/2022/06/28/edward-o-thorp-2/">Master Investor Ed Thorp on How to think for yourself and many more topics</a> – This is a long format podcast but there&#8217;s some invaluable takeaways from Ed&#8217;s experience. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings&nbsp;</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/06/24/ML-code-gen-vs-coding-by-hand-future">ML Codegen Vs Coding by Hand</a> – In the previous musings I shared about auto code-gen and it got me intrigued into aspects that are debatable and why we should tread with care. This post explores some of this nuance and has a good further reading on other thoughts on the same topic as well</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If you really think that the environment is less important than the economy, try holding your breath while you count your money.”</p><cite>Guy McPherson</cite></blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>What worries me!</em></strong></h3>



<p>It’s hard to miss the series of natural calamities rocking the already pandemic struck world right now. From the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/19/google_oracle_cloud/?mc_cid=1674b3c928&amp;mc_eid=2b8cf1fb98">extreme heat waves in UK &amp; Europe</a> to <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/asia/2022/07/21/indias-monsoon-havoc-a-result-of-climate-change-experts-say/">Cloud bursts and Flash floods in India</a>, It’s time each one of us do our part to slow down climate change. <a href="https://medium.com/@cinthia.espino/why-is-0-5-c-so-important-3961b9989387">Read this</a> if you want to know what a 0.5° Celsius change could mean to earth and <a href="https://coastal.climatecentral.org/map/10/72.9068/18.9721/?theme=sea_level_rise&amp;map_type=year&amp;basemap=roadmap&amp;contiguous=true&amp;elevation_model=best_available&amp;forecast_year=2040&amp;pathway=ssp3rcp70&amp;percentile=p50&amp;refresh=true&amp;return_level=return_level_0&amp;rl_model=gtsr&amp;slr_model=ipcc_2021_med">see these projections</a> of cities that would be under water if the sea-levels continues to rise.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I’m listening</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://tim.blog/2022/06/28/edward-o-thorp-2/">Master Investor Ed Thorp on How to think for yourself and many more topics</a> – This is a long format podcast but there&#8217;s some invaluable takeaways from Ed&#8217;s experience. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</p>

This post explores some of this nuance and has a good further reading on other thoughts on the same topic as well</p>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’m reading.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-i-become-director-guru-bhat/">How can I become a Director? </a> – A very well written piece by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurubhat/">Guru Bhat</a> on what it takes to become a director. Eloquent as always, Guru hits the bulls eye on some key attributes that everyone should aspire to attain if they are on a quest for this title. I’ve been fortunate to learn by experience how “Bias for Action” can be a key differentiator in creating value for our stakeholders.</p>
