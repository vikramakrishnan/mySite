<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://jitha.substack.com/p/sunday-reads-164-how-much-would-you" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How much would you pay for a box that beeps!</a> – This article had interesting nuggets on how to pitch a product to the customer and set the price for it. It underscores the fact that customers don’t buy your product for its cutting-edge spec or features, they are buying it for solving their problem, so focus on the problem and you’ll never have to worry about lack of customers. This is applicable for everything that we do, day in and day out.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History</a> – How did one man’s effort or a specific business’s interest create a long standing health problem and environmental catastrophe of the modern world is the premise of this video. I personally learnt a lot of new and interesting things in the video. Some parts chemistry, some parts psychology and a bit of economics!</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I Listened</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/thriving-in-the-face-of-contradiction/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Thriving In The Face Of Contradiction</a> – Another good one from Hidden Brain. From the podcast excerpt &#8211; “<em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we’re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either/or choices. But psychologist <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/wendy-smith/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wendy Smith</a> says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap. She offers a different way to think about difficult choices, one that opens unexpected possibilities.”</em></p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings  </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://dev.to/jeroendedauw/advice-for-junior-developers-30am" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Advice for Junior Developers</a> – I wish I read this before talking to a bunch of junior devs a couple days ago. This article presents an important list of things that budding devs should start assimilating as part of their work. While many of us would feel this is intuitive, actioning it needs intentional practice.</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Someone with half your IQ is making 10x as you because they aren&#8217;t smart enough to doubt themselves.</p><cite>Ed Latimore</cite></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hg1K0HD5Xo" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Locked in a machine for 70 years</a> – Inspiring story of Paul Alexander, a polio survivor, who beat the odds and continues to be one of last surviving people living in an Iron Lung.

<h3><strong><em>Places I’ve Travelled</em></strong></h3>



<p>Completed a long pending trip to Sikkim &amp; Darjeeling with the family.&nbsp; I&#8217;d highly recommend this as a place to visit for your next vacation. Sikkim is mind bogglingly beautiful with friendly people, interesting culture and history. Did you know that Sikkim was an independent country/Kingdom until 1975 when it was officially annexed and made the 22nd state of India.&nbsp;<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOaG2S8tci_elc8ogyIvUJq8d0W5Y0seDuLR9eugvLR0hgy96lpLRkgnpCvJsCuyw?key=NzNRU2xJX0JhaERVc0lKVHp6OGRMNUxRME5LZUpB" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Here&#8217;s some photos from my trip.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/08/17/1058013/electric-planes-taking-off-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Electric Planes taking off challenges!</a> – Climate change is real and it&#8217;s interesting to see these technical advances that could potentially slowdown negative effects. Green Hydrogen and alternate fuels sound promising, but until we could find an economical way to produce them, decarbonizing travel is still seems far away.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I watched</em></strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-emily-balcetis-tools-for-setting-and-achieving-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Dr. Emily Balcetis: Tools For Setting &amp; Achieving Goals</a> &#8211; This is long format science podcast I love and this episode talks about how visual perceptions can influence our level of motivation  and our emotional state as we pursue complex goals in life. One of the interesting things I learnt from this episode, that I&#8217;ve started using is the visual tools to keep track of progress. <a href="https://1se.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">1 Second Everyday</a> is slowly becoming part of my daily life.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings </em></strong></h3>

While Deepfake identification models are getting their own share of attention, I haven&#8217;t come across one in mainstream news.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/a-team-where-everyone-is-a-leader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">An Engineering team where everyone is a leader</a> – A very well written piece with practical tips for managers and leaders on how to build a team where each engineer is empowered to make decisions and leads from the front.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biNMRQJXvfs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Why No One Can Agree What’s REALLY the Tallest Mountain</a> – Did you know that the longest mountain range in earth is under sea and the tallest peak isn&#8217;t necessarily the Everest? There&#8217;s never a time when I have come out of a video from this channel without learning something new and also wondering how some of the simplest things we assume from our schooling can actually be very complex.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Books I’m (re) Reading</em></strong></h3>



<p>Reread my notes from the book  <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3450744-nudge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Nudge</a> after listening to the recent episode of Hidden Brain on &#8220;<a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-2-0-how-to-see-yourself-clearly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">How to see yourself clearly</a>&#8220;. The concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">choice architecture</a> and its influence on people as described in Nudge made me think about comment from the podcast – “<em>We often make important decisions in our life and love for reasons we don&#8217;t even realize</em>”</p>

<p><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/why-firefox-deserves-its-sad-decline-1c44d9ba59c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Firefox and its sad decline&#8230;</a> – I love Firefox, but this is an example what happens to a product when there&#8217;s mis-timing, lack of customer focus and market understanding issues coupled with bad decisions. It&#8217;s sad to see Firefox fall from over 34% browser market share in 2010 to less than 3.5% currently.</p>
