										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recently, I spoke to a group of new managers (mostly) and people who&#8217;ve transitioned from a Product/Program Management role about surprises that new people managers encounter. This talk was a drill down (albeit with a slight improvisation) on the research conducted by <a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=michael%20e.%20porter" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Michael E. Porter,</a><a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=jay%20w.%20lorsch" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Jay W. Lorsch,</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=nitin%20nohria" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Nitin Nohria</a> which was outlined in their 2004 HBR article titled <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://hbr.org/2004/10/seven-surprises-for-new-ceos" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external"><em>Seven Surprises for New CEOs </em></a>. While the article dates back to 2004, the findings remain relevant even today.</p>



<p>While the original content was written with CEOs in mind, I&#8217;ve adapted that to managers at all levels given the audience of this networking session.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong><em>Management</em></strong> is both  <strong><em>Art</em></strong> and <strong><em>Science</em></strong>. It is <em>science</em> because there&#8217;s systemic study material, repeatable processes, and causality that can be learnt. It&#8217;s an Art because management requires a considerable amount of skill, practice, creativity and Individual application &#8211; what works for one may not work for another person. It&#8217;s therefore imperative to understand what one can expect as they embark on their management journey and chart a course for success. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with what new managers may find surprising as they embark on their management journey</p>



<br style="clear:left"><hr class="flaired">



<h3>You <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">can&#8217;t</mark> do everything</h3>



<p>As you enter management, you have to get comfortable with the feeling that you can&#8217;t be directly involved with everything that&#8217;s happening in your project / organization, yet you are fully accountable for outcomes &amp; results. This is in stark contrast to back when you were an individual contributor and now your time will be needed in more places than you can imagine.</p>



<p>To avoid/overcome problems with this surprise, you have to learn to</p>



<ol><li>Effectively <a href="#delegation">Delegate</a> to your direct reports and trust them</li><li>Manage your <a href="#timemanagement">time efficiently</a></li></ol>



<h3>You <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">can&#8217;t</mark> always tell people what to do</h3>



<p>You cannot micromanage every decision by telling people how to do things. Like Steve jobs said &#8220;<code><em>It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to to , We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do</em></code><strong><em>.</em>”</strong> We should enable people by providing the right amount of clarity on the needs and expectations around outcomes/ results and provide autonomy to execute.</p>



<p>Practice the following and you&#8217;ll steer clear and learn more</p>



<ul><li>Provide Clarity<ul><li>Set Vision &amp; Standards </li><li>Define operating principles (review cadence, stakeholder communication, cost etc)</li><li>Learn from mistakes (remember that we all learn from our mistakes, so create and embrace a culture where people can freely talk about failures and learnings from them)</li></ul></li><li>Avoid Decision Bottlenecks<ul><li>Share power and make people part of the decision making process. This can hugely improve trust.</li><li>Encourage the culture of calculated risk taking.</li><li>Learn and make use of <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://www.guru99.com/decision-making-tools.html" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Decision making tools</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>You <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">won&#8217;t</mark> always know what&#8217;s going on</h3>



<p>As a manager, you&#8217;ll have a lot of things going on around you (meetings, stakeholder management, planning, people issues, budgeting, hiring, performance management and tons more). Amidst all of that, it&#8217;s very difficult to keep track of every aspect of what&#8217;s happening. People won&#8217;t immediately be willing to give you the bad news, so by the time it gets to you, it may be late or have some glossy touches added.</p>



<p>But to manage effectively, you need to stay on top of things and be in the loop. Here are some thoughts on what can help you get there.</p>



<ul><li>Identify ways to collect as much information as possible about what&#8217;s happening in the team from different sources.<ul><li>Practice <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_wandering_around" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Management by walking around (MBWA)</a></li><li>Another alternate is <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemba#:~:text=The%20Gemba%20Walk%20is%20an,results%20or%20make%20superficial%20comments." target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Gemba walk</a>, popularized by Toyota, where you walk to the place where the action happens, ask questions and learn.</li><li>Have skip level 1:1s and team meetings.</li></ul></li><li>Build strong partnerships with all your stakeholders<ul><li>Talk to your peers, customers, cross functional leaders, HR partners etc. This will give you a rounded perspective of what&#8217;s happening.</li></ul></li></ul>



<h3>You are always being <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">watched</mark>!</h3>



<p>I don&#8217;t&#8217; say this as something to be scared about, but as a manager/leader of the organization, you are always sending a message. The way you speak (or don’t speak!), your body language, choice of words, way to write, everything starts to matter now. People will try to read between lines and there are chances you can be misinterpreted.</p>



<p>To avoid potential issues because of this, try to</p>



<ul><li>Lead by example. Role model the behavior you would like to see in your team members. Your actions will soon be replicated in your team, so use it to your advantage.</li><li>Communicate clearly and ask for clarifications. Don&#8217;t assume people understood what you said.</li><li>Improve your self-awareness and Emotional Quotient</li><li>This is a continuous learning process, so you will have Blind spots. Get an <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://actionbuddy.io/blog/accountability-partner#:~:text=An%20accountability%20partner%20is%20someone,to%20stick%20to%20their%20commitments." target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">accountability partner</a> who can help provide feedback.</li></ul>



<h3>Organizational Politics is <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">real</mark>!</h3>



<p>Not all politics is bad. <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://opentext.wsu.edu/organizational-behavior/chapter/13-4-organizational-politics/" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Organizational politics</a> is real and how well you deal with it will also define your success trajectory. <a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/the-4-types-of-organizational-politics" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Studies show</a> that individuals with political skills tend to have a greater impact on organizational outcomes. Understanding and navigating organizational politics and improving your influencing authority will provide better outcomes for your teams.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-301" width="333" height="303" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png 329w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-300x273.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /><figcaption>Credits: Mindtools &#8211; <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_07.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Stakeholder Analysis</a></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Here are some thoughts about how to handle this</p>



<ul><li>Be Politically Savvy. What this means is that you are aware of what’s going on around you, you’re paying attention to the dynamics, paying attention to who has power and influence, and what the culture of your organization is, and you are positioning yourself successfully with all that information.</li><li>Build and leverage your network.</li><li>Understand your stakeholders and map them. <em>Power/interest grid for stakeholder prioritization</em> on the left can be one useful technique.</li></ul>



<div style="clear:right"></div>



<h3>You are still only <mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#cf0808" class="has-inline-color">Human</mark>!</h3>



<p>You must remember that your position as a manager/leader does not automatically make you better or more capable. Like everyone else, you will learn from experience and the many mistakes that&#8217;ll provide important lessons along the way. However, as a manager, you have more accountability and responsibility, and how you role model your behaviors will be replicated.</p>



<p>It is essential to keep the following things in mind as you embark on your management/leadership journey.</p>



<ul><li>Your Work/Life balance is extremely important and how you manage it will be emulated by your team. Remember your mood will affect your team&#8217;s mood as well.<ul><li>A friend once gave me this priority list that I strive to follow &#8211; Health -> Family -> Relationships -> Work</li></ul></li><li>Being vulnerable and asking for help will improve trust with your teams and you&#8217;ll achieve more together.</li><li>Be Thankful, stay humble and praise generously.</li><li>Get a mentor/coach who can help you along the way and share their learnings.</li></ul>

<h4>Appendix</h4>



<ul id="delegation"><li><strong><em>Delegation</em></strong> is the assignment of authority to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to carry out specific activities. It is the process of distributing and entrusting work to another person, and therefore one of the core concepts of management leadership. The process involves managers deciding which work they should do themselves and which work should be delegated to others for completion.[1] From a managerial standpoint, delegation involves shifting project responsibility to team members, giving them the opportunity to finalize the work product effectively, with minimal intervention. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make decisions. It is a shifting of decision-making authority as well as responsibility for the results from one organisational level to another lower one. However, a certain level of accountability for the outcome of the work does remain with the person who delegated the work to begin with.<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/how-to-delegate-effectively" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">How to Delegate Effectively</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener external" href="https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1401615513998950401" target="_blank" data-wpel-link="external">Radical Delegation by Shreyas Doshi</a></li></ul></li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic, gardening has rapidly become a way to rejuvenate and is now a core family activity. Watching seeds germinate, flowers blossom, plants flourish(and sometimes dry out and die), I couldn’t help but draw parallels to management&nbsp;and the lessons we can learn from them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-center has-small-font-size" style="font-style:normal;font-weight:500"><blockquote><p><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><strong><em>The glory of gardening: hands in the dirt, head in the sun, heart with nature. To nurture a garden is to feed not just on the body, but the soul. &#8211; </em></strong></mark><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><em>Alfred Austin</em></mark></strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:138px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="641" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-106" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil.jpeg 960w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil-300x200.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sunsoil-768x513.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Soil &amp; Sunlight &#8211; It all starts here</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Every plant needs a specific type of soil to flourish. Clay, Sandy, Silty, or Peaty.&nbsp;There are many&nbsp;combinations depending on what plants you’ve got. Likewise, sunlight is also an important growth factor. Some plants need full sunlight, others need partial shade, while some grow remarkably well indoors with minimal light. Using the wrong soil type or lighting is a sure shot way to fail.</p>



<p>Like soil and&nbsp;sunlight form the foundation for the growth of plants, the right work assignments determine your team&#8217;s success.&nbsp;<em>New project features</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>fixing tech debt</em>&nbsp;<em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>support</em>&nbsp;<em>vs</em>&nbsp;<em>building a product from scratch</em>, each needs a specific type of individual. Some are suited to platform work, some can learn new tech quickly and adapt to a fast-paced environment, some are very good at dealing with ambiguity, etc, so identify the right place for team members based on their skills, interests &amp; aspirations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:151px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-107" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/waterfert.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/waterfert.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/waterfert-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#f3f2f2" class="has-inline-color">Water &amp; Fertilizer &#8211; Keep up the growth</mark></strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Now that you have foundations out of the way, let&#8217;s talk about regular care.</p>



<p>Water and fertilizer are two very important&nbsp;needs for a splendid garden. Every plant in your garden may have&nbsp;a specific need. Some don’t need any fertilizer for months, while others need it every week. Same with water. Some plants have&nbsp;to be watered daily and others are drought resistant and can sustain for weeks. Root rot, yellowing leaves, stunted growth, fertilizer burns, etc are very common issues you&#8217;ll see in gardening support forums and the only way to fix them is to fix your watering and fertilizing schedules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In management, this is like providing the right training, setting the right expectations, and following up on progress. Inadequate or incorrect training will create under-skilled members&nbsp;and frustrate the team.&nbsp;Lack of expectation setting and follow-up on progress will lead to suboptimal outcomes. Some team members do well with very minimal follow-up, whereas others will either need frequent follow-ups or someone to assist them continuously to ensure progress.&nbsp;<em>RCG&#8217;s, mid-level engineers, senior engineers, architects, managers</em>&nbsp;&#8211; each one has a different need and successful leaders should be mindful of these, spot opportunities, provide clarity for the team to flourish.</p>



<p>As a manager regularly ask yourself &#8211; Does your team have the right skills needed for the job? Do you micromanage a lot when you should let the team decide? Do you stay away from the action, only to pitch in when a crisis occurs?. Get your team&#8217;s feedback and adapt.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:96px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="264" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-102" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/climbers-300x198.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-text-color has-large-font-size" style="color:#fefdfd"><strong>Climbers need stability &amp; support</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>If you’ve grown flowering climbers (like Allamanda or morning glory) you may have noticed that beyond a certain height they can no longer grow without support. Strong Climbers sometimes use other branches in the same plant to continue growing, but even that has a limit.</p>



<p>The same is true for you and your team. Beyond a certain limit, they can no longer grow without leadership support. As a manager, always create the right support ecosystem both within and outside your teams. Find the right coaching / mentoring opportunities and share them. Have regular 1:1s and create an individual development plan which aligns with their aspirations.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:119px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-105" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/seedsorstem-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Seeds or stem cuttings &#8211; building next-gen</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>While you may have picked the best seeds or the strongest cuttings for propagation, you may never see a 100% success rate. Anything between 50-70% is a respectable success rate and you’ll eventually get better. Time is another important factor to consider too. Some seeds germinate quickly while others will take more time, don’t judge too soon, and start taking action.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll have similar observations during hiring as well. Someone fantastic during interviews&nbsp;can&nbsp;be inefficient at the job and an average person could&nbsp;be a rockstar. Give it time, observe progress at regular intervals, and course-correct accordingly. Don&#8217;t be too hard on yourself if you land a bad hire. Learn from it and move on. You&#8217;ll get better, eventually.</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover is-light" style="min-height:96px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="267" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-104" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/repot-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-large-font-size"><strong>Re-Potting &#8211; Moving on&#8230;</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>All plants eventually outgrow their containers. For you to sustain their growth and keep them from dying, you’ll need to move them to a larger pot with more soil/nutrients.</p>



<p>Likewise, in management, you should always watch out for successful people on your teams who are now ready for expanded roles, scope, etc, and create opportunities for them to grow. Depending on your situation, you may need to move them to other teams or, in some rare cases, even encourage them to look outside of the company. Remember, this is both good for the individual and the team. You don’t want cracked pots or stunted plants!</p>



<div class="wp-block-cover" style="min-height:111px"><span aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img loading="lazy" width="400" height="288" class="wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-103" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning.jpeg" data-object-fit="cover" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning.jpeg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pruning-300x216.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><div class="wp-block-cover__inner-container">
<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Pruning &#8211; It&#8217;s never easy</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Pruning boosts yields, improves aesthetics, reduces diseases &amp; prevents infestations. Every beautiful garden needs regular pruning. Don’t be afraid to prune &#8211; knowing when and how are important skills every gardener should learn.</p>



<p>Likewise, managers need&nbsp;to review their team structure periodically and make changes. You may have to remove misfits and underperformers, deliberately move out people who’ve been in your team for long to other teams, so they can grow (and your team can grow/adapt as well) or split teams into smaller units so they are more focused. Being a successful manager requires you to master these skills and know when the time is right to apply them.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-verse"><em><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">It’s important to realize that whether in plants or humans, growth is the same, and demands much of the same conditions and requirements. It’s hard work, takes a lot of effort and patience, but like a proud gardener admiring the beauty of their garden, seeing your team grow and succeed is both a rewarding and fulfilling part of being a manager.</span></em></pre>
