<p>Embarking on the journey from an Individual Contributor (IC) role to a managerial position marks a significant milestone/decision in one&#8217;s career. Lately, I&#8217;ve observed a growing trend of individuals grappling with this transition amidst the ever-shifting currents of the workplace.</p>



<p>As I reflect on my journey, I&#8217;m transported back to that moment over a decade ago when I made the leap from being an accomplished lead engineer on PayPal&#8217;s Core Platforms team to assuming the mantle of a manager within the same team. The questions, uncertainties, and challenges that punctuated that juncture continue to resonate with many who find themselves at a similar crossroads today.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity has-blush-light-purple-gradient-background has-background is-style-default"/>



<h2>Address the WHY?</h2>



<p>Understanding the motivations behind your decision to transition into a management role is paramount, as it sets the foundation for your long-term success. Consider the following questions:</p>



<p><strong>What are your motivations driving this transition?</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Are you drawn to the potential for accelerated career growth that management offers compared to an individual contributor role?</em></li>



<li><em>Has your current leader recognized leadership qualities in you and offered you the role based on your demonstrated behaviors?</em></li>



<li><em>Are you considering the switch because your peers have expressed confidence in your managerial potential, and you&#8217;ve been exhibiting behaviors that resonate with effective leadership?</em></li>



<li><em>Do you believe that your skills and ambitions are better aligned with the responsibilities of a successful manager?</em></li>
</ul>



<p>You may have <strong><em>more than one reason</em></strong> from the above example or some other completely different reason, but it&#8217;s important that you spend time thinking about it honestly as it&#8217;ll guide your progress and help identify areas that you need to focus on.</p>



<p><strong><em>One important caveat</em></strong> to bear in mind is that if you&#8217;re considering this transition solely for the sake of growth opportunities and nothing else, it&#8217;s crucial to pause and reconsider. Making this decision based solely on perceived advancement prospects can potentially compromise both your effectiveness in the role and your long-term well-being. It&#8217;s worth noting that many corporations offer parallel career tracks that allow individual contributors to experience significant growth and development similar to those in managerial positions. Take a moment to reassess your motivations and consider the broader implications before proceeding.</p>



<br><hr class="flaired">



<h2>Identify Necessary Skillsets</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s crucial to identify the skillsets required for a successful transition into management and assess your current proficiency level, as well as your plans to learn or enhance these skills.</p>



<p><strong>Effective Communication</strong>: This will serve as your superpower in your new role. Unlike your code, which spoke for itself as an individual contributor, your ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, will be essential for managerial success.</p>



<p><strong>Strategic Thinking:</strong> Managers must navigate the organizational landscape strategically, understanding overarching objectives, defining priorities, and anticipating trends. Unlike individual contributors, who focus on depth, managers must take a breadth-first approach, making trade-off decisions in an ever-changing ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong>Decision Making &amp; Dealing with Ambiguity:</strong> Managers must be comfortable making decisions with incomplete information and be willing to revisit and adjust decisions as needed.</p>



<p><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Managers are responsible for handling conflicts within the team and across stakeholders diplomatically to maintain productivity and progress.</p>



<p><strong>Time Management:</strong> Effective time management, including prioritization and delegation, is essential for balancing multiple responsibilities in managerial roles.</p>



<p><strong>Emotional Intelligence:</strong> Understanding and addressing the emotional needs of the team and building trust are crucial for fostering high-performance team dynamics.</p>



<br><hr class="flaired">



<h2>Assess your comfort to some hard truths of management</h2>



<p><strong>Accountability vs. Delegation: </strong>While you&#8217;re accountable for the team&#8217;s results, you won&#8217;t be executing all the work yourself. Success hinges on your ability to delegate effectively and empower others to deliver.</p>



<p><strong>Impact on Others:</strong> Your actions as a manager will significantly impact the happiness and well-being of your team members. Their success and satisfaction are intertwined with your effectiveness as a leader.</p>



<p><strong>Delayed Gratification:</strong> Unlike the immediate feedback of resolving technical issues, the outcomes of management efforts may take months or even years to materialize. Patience and long-term vision are essential.</p>



<p><strong>From Tech Debt to Management Debt:</strong> Transitioning from handling technical challenges to managing people introduces a new set of responsibilities, including addressing &#8220;management debt&#8221; such as team dynamics and performance issues.</p>



<p><strong>Shift in Focus: </strong>Your primary focus will shift from coding and architecture to activities like conducting 1:1 meetings, setting performance goals, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and delivering presentations.</p>



<p><strong>Different Skill Set:</strong> Managing people requires a distinct skill set from managing code. Formal authority alone is insufficient to drive change; effective leadership involves understanding and motivating individuals.</p>



<br><hr class="flaired">



<h2>Charting the Course</h2>



<p><strong>Identify Relevant Training Opportunities:</strong> Work with your leaders to Explore available training programs, workshops, or resources that can help you develop essential management skills. Look for opportunities that align with your learning objectives and career goals, such as leadership development courses or mentorship programs.</p>



<p><strong>Trial Period or Exploration:</strong> Consider trying out aspects of management in a temporary or experimental capacity before committing to a permanent transition. This could involve shadowing a manager, leading a small project or team initiative, or volunteering for leadership roles in cross-functional projects to gain firsthand experience and assess your suitability for the role.</p>



<p><strong>Contingency Planning:</strong> Anticipate potential challenges or obstacles that may arise during the transition process and develop contingency plans to mitigate them. Identify potential rollback options or exit strategies, such as revisiting your original role or seeking alternative career paths, in case the transition does not proceed as planned.</p>



<p><strong>Feedback and Reflection:</strong> Seek feedback from peers, mentors, or managers throughout the transition process to identify areas for improvement and ensure alignment with organizational expectations.</p>



<br><hr class="flaired">



<h2>Things to remember</h2>



<p>Here are some important reminders to keep in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Role Modeling Behaviors:</strong> Remember that your actions as a manager will set the tone for your team. Be mindful of the behaviors you exhibit, as your team members will often emulate your approach to work, communication, and collaboration.</p>



<p><strong>Exhibiting Vulnerability:</strong> Embrace vulnerability and acknowledge that you don&#8217;t have all the answers. It&#8217;s okay to seek input from your team, admit mistakes, and ask for help when needed. This fosters a culture of openness, trust, and continuous learning within your team.</p>



<p><strong>Seeking Feedback: </strong>Actively solicit feedback from your team members on your leadership style, communication effectiveness, and areas for improvement. Constructive feedback can provide valuable insights for personal and professional growth and strengthen team dynamics.</p>



<p><strong>Networking Within the Company:</strong> Cultivate strong relationships and networks within your organization. Building rapport with colleagues from different departments can be invaluable for gaining support, sharing insights, and navigating challenges effectively, especially during times of crisis.</p>



<p><strong>Thinking About Systems and Processes:</strong> Look beyond day-to-day tasks and consider the broader systems and processes within your team and organization. Identifying areas for optimization, streamlining workflows, and implementing best practices can improve efficiency, effectiveness, and overall team performance.</p>



<p><strong>Finding a Mentor or Coach:</strong> Consider seeking guidance from experienced mentors or coaches who can offer support, advice, and perspective as you navigate the challenges of management. Their insights and expertise can help accelerate your development and enhance your effectiveness as a leader.</p>



<p><strong>Maintaining Technical Skills:</strong> Being a manager doesn&#8217;t mean you abandon your technical skills. You can still contribute by picking up small, non-urgent tasks, or assisting with technical challenges when needed. This not only supports your team but also demonstrates your commitment to staying engaged with the technical aspects of the work.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Relating to an old Indian proverb, Don&#8217;t aspire to be a banyan tree leader who shields &amp; protects the team in all situations. Remember that while shade is great, there can be no growth if there&#8217;s no exposure to sunlight. Be the guiding light that empowers others to flourish on their own.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>In conclusion, transitioning from an individual contributor to a management role is a significant step in your career journey. By understanding your motivations, honing essential skill sets, acknowledging the challenges ahead, and charting a clear execution plan, you can navigate this transition with confidence and success. Remember, the path to becoming an effective manager is not without its obstacles, but with dedication, resilience, and a willingness to learn and grow, you can unlock new opportunities for personal and professional fulfillment. Embrace the journey ahead, and may it lead you to new heights of leadership and accomplishment. <strong><em>Remember, your job is not to create followers, your job is to create more leaders.</em></strong></p>

While greater flexibility will lead to greater productivity, it is important to have a clearly defined process and guideposts that prevent employees from straying too far away from a collaborative working schedule.</p>

While I’ve gotten progressively better it’s important to understand the underlying reasons for why we put off things so we can learn to become better. This video talks about the importance of balancing emotions and how they can affect why we put off certain things and what we can do to change.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://jitha.substack.com/p/sunday-reads-164-how-much-would-you" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How much would you pay for a box that beeps!</a> – This article had interesting nuggets on how to pitch a product to the customer and set the price for it. It underscores the fact that customers don’t buy your product for its cutting-edge spec or features, they are buying it for solving their problem, so focus on the problem and you’ll never have to worry about lack of customers. This is applicable for everything that we do, day in and day out.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History</a> – How did one man’s effort or a specific business’s interest create a long standing health problem and environmental catastrophe of the modern world is the premise of this video. I personally learnt a lot of new and interesting things in the video. Some parts chemistry, some parts psychology and a bit of economics!</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I Listened</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/thriving-in-the-face-of-contradiction/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Thriving In The Face Of Contradiction</a> – Another good one from Hidden Brain. From the podcast excerpt &#8211; “<em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we’re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either/or choices. But psychologist <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/wendy-smith/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wendy Smith</a> says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap. She offers a different way to think about difficult choices, one that opens unexpected possibilities.”</em></p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings  </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://dev.to/jeroendedauw/advice-for-junior-developers-30am" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Advice for Junior Developers</a> – I wish I read this before talking to a bunch of junior devs a couple days ago. This article presents an important list of things that budding devs should start assimilating as part of their work. While many of us would feel this is intuitive, actioning it needs intentional practice.</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Someone with half your IQ is making 10x as you because they aren&#8217;t smart enough to doubt themselves.</p><cite>Ed Latimore</cite></blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Places I’ve Travelled</em></strong></h3>



<p>Completed a long pending trip to Sikkim &amp; Darjeeling with the family.&nbsp; I&#8217;d highly recommend this as a place to visit for your next vacation.

Did you know that Sikkim was an independent country/Kingdom until 1975 when it was officially annexed and made the 22nd state of India.&nbsp;<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOaG2S8tci_elc8ogyIvUJq8d0W5Y0seDuLR9eugvLR0hgy96lpLRkgnpCvJsCuyw?key=NzNRU2xJX0JhaERVc0lKVHp6OGRMNUxRME5LZUpB" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Here&#8217;s some photos from my trip.</a></p>

From the article &#8211; “<em>While most of us admit we are far less than perfect, we often find it quite difficult to accept others’ imperfection. If we are to handle difficult situations successfully, we must accept that people can be both flawed and fabulous</em>.”</p>
