<h3><strong><em>Articles I’ve read.</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://jitha.substack.com/p/sunday-reads-164-how-much-would-you" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How much would you pay for a box that beeps!</a> – This article had interesting nuggets on how to pitch a product to the customer and set the price for it. It underscores the fact that customers don’t buy your product for its cutting-edge spec or features, they are buying it for solving their problem, so focus on the problem and you’ll never have to worry about lack of customers. This is applicable for everything that we do, day in and day out.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The Man Who Accidentally Killed The Most People In History</a> – How did one man’s effort or a specific business’s interest create a long standing health problem and environmental catastrophe of the modern world is the premise of this video. I personally learnt a lot of new and interesting things in the video. Some parts chemistry, some parts psychology and a bit of economics!</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I Listened</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/thriving-in-the-face-of-contradiction/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Thriving In The Face Of Contradiction</a> – Another good one from Hidden Brain. From the podcast excerpt &#8211; “<em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we’re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either/or choices. But psychologist <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/wendy-smith/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wendy Smith</a> says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap. She offers a different way to think about difficult choices, one that opens unexpected possibilities.”</em></p>



<h3><strong><em>Tech Readings  </em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://dev.to/jeroendedauw/advice-for-junior-developers-30am" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Advice for Junior Developers</a> – I wish I read this before talking to a bunch of junior devs a couple days ago. This article presents an important list of things that budding devs should start assimilating as part of their work. While many of us would feel this is intuitive, actioning it needs intentional practice.</p>



<h3><em>Quote I&#8217;m thinking about</em></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Someone with half your IQ is making 10x as you because they aren&#8217;t smart enough to doubt themselves.</p><cite>Ed Latimore</cite></blockquote>

<h3><strong><em>Videos I Watched</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hg1K0HD5Xo" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Locked in a machine for 70 years</a> – Inspiring story of Paul Alexander, a polio survivor, who beat the odds and continues to be one of last surviving people living in an Iron Lung. It was emotional for me to know the hardships he had to overcome and still achieve things many can only dream about.</p>



<h3><strong><em>Podcasts I Listened</em></strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/whats-wrong-with-holding-a-grudge/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">No Stupid Questions &#8211; What&#8217;s wrong with holding a grudge?</a> – Another good conversation between Angela and Stephen where they talk about the emotional cost of grudge, how to let go of resentment, whether Apologies work.</p>

<p><a href="https://makeavideo.studio/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Make-A-Video</a> &amp; <a href="https://phenaki.github.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Phenaki</a> – Following Meta AI’s announcement 2 weeks ago of their “text to Video” generator, Google has release 2 of their own text to video generators this week.

<h3><strong><em>Places I’ve Travelled</em></strong></h3>



<p>Completed a long pending trip to Sikkim &amp; Darjeeling with the family.&nbsp; I&#8217;d highly recommend this as a place to visit for your next vacation. Sikkim is mind bogglingly beautiful with friendly people, interesting culture and history. Did you know that Sikkim was an independent country/Kingdom until 1975 when it was officially annexed and made the 22nd state of India.&nbsp;<a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOaG2S8tci_elc8ogyIvUJq8d0W5Y0seDuLR9eugvLR0hgy96lpLRkgnpCvJsCuyw?key=NzNRU2xJX0JhaERVc0lKVHp6OGRMNUxRME5LZUpB" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Here&#8217;s some photos from my trip.</a></p>

<h6>Here&#8217;s a list of Podcast episodes i&#8217;ve found worth sharing.</h6>



<ul><li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/thriving-in-the-face-of-contradiction/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Thriving In The Face Of Contradiction</a> – Another good one from Hidden Brain. From the podcast excerpt &#8211; “ <em>We all face tough decisions in life, whether we’re juggling the demands of work and family or deciding whether to take a new job. These situations often feel like either/or choices. But psychologist <a href="https://lerner.udel.edu/faculty-staff-directory/wendy-smith/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wendy Smith</a> says this binary way of confronting dilemmas contains a trap. She offers a different way to think about difficult choices, one that opens unexpected possibilities.”</em></li><li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/whats-wrong-with-holding-a-grudge/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">No Stupid Questions &#8211; What&#8217;s wrong with holding a grudge?</a> – Another good conversation between Angela and Stephen where they talk about the emotional cost of grudge, how to let go of resentment, whether Apologies work.</li><li><a href="https://allinchamathjason.libsyn.com/e96-adobe-acquires-figma-for-20b-tpb-spac-fedex-ceos-recession-warning-macro-picture-more" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">All-In &#8211; Adobe acquires Figma for $20B, TPB SPAC, FedEx CEO&#8217;s recession warning, macro picture &amp; more</a> – It takes some getting used to this podcast format of multi-participant discussion on varied topics, but once you are over it, you’ll come to appreciate the depth of analysis on topics and the amount of critical thinking involved and the kind of questions raised. In this episode Chamath, sacks and others dissect the Adobe-Figma deal &amp; fears of a global recession.</li><li><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/worklife_with_adam_grant_authenticity_is_a_double_edged_sword" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Authenticity is a double-edged sword</a> – Another gem from Adam Grant where he talks about what effective authenticity looks like and how we can learn to strike the right balance.</li><li><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Sleep Toolkit: Tools For Optimizing Sleep &amp; Sleep-Wake Timing</a> &#8211; Dr. Huberman provides practical tips to improve and optimize sleep patterns. I&#8217;ve personally incorporated some of this (morning sunlight exposure, core body temperature rise, early dinner)  in my daily routine and can definitely see improvements in waking up energy, sleep quality etc.</li><li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/you-2-0-befriending-your-inner-voice/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">You 2.0 &#8211; Befriending your inner voice</a> – What we say to ourselves, and our inner voice is a big contributor to how we think, act, react and transform.

While it’s not always good to keep the pot boiling, Anger as evolutionary measure does come in handy in situations and it is important we learn more about how to tackle our emotions and understand its effects.</li><li><a href="https://tim.blog/2022/06/28/edward-o-thorp-2/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Master Investor Ed Thorp on How to think for yourself and many more topics</a> – This is a long format podcast but there&#8217;s some invaluable takeaways from Ed&#8217;s experience. I&#8217;m a big fan of the Tim&#8217;s questions to his guests and the insights that he gleans from them. What particularly excited me in this podcast was how Ed was leveraging the power of compounding in anything he does, be it investing, loosing weight, forming habits, learning new things etc. Really loved the concept of &#8220;scrap time&#8221; and hope to incorporate in my life as well.</li><li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/why-youre-smarter-than-you-think/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Why you&#8217;re smarter than you think!</a> – From the Hidden brain show notes – “ <em>From the time we are schoolchildren, we are ranked and sorted based on how smart we are.

This week, psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman proposes a more expansive notion of what it means to be “smart</em> &#8220;.</li><li><a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-simple-is-too-simple/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><strong>How simple is too simple</strong></a> – <em>In this episode of “No Stupid Questions”, Angela Duckworth and Stephen Dubner discuss the obsession humans have with magic bullet solutions and why there are no simple answers.</em></li><li><a href="https://link.chtbl.com/KmhQvIwN" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How to Change Your Workplace</a> – Adam Grant’s “Work Life” has been one of my all-time favorite podcasts and in this episode he delves into “Change” and how each one of us no matter where we are in the hierarchy can bring about meaningful, positive, long-lasting change and motivate people to embrace new ideas.</li><li><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/why-conversations-go-wrong/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Mind Reading 2.0: Why Conversations go wrong</a> hosted by Shankar Vedantam (<a href="https://twitter.com/HiddenBrain" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">@HiddenBrain</a>) where they talk about conversational styles and why understanding them is important to be able to effectively communicate.</li></ul>
